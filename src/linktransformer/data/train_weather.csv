"WWELeTAN AEN LU }— Re
publican hopes of regaming con
trol of the Senate were joltec
today by news from Ohio that
offset a recent jolt Democratic
hopes received from Nevada.

The bad news for the Republi-
cans came in Wednesday night’s
announcement that Democratic
Gov. Frank J. Lausche of Ohio
will mun next year for the Sen-
ate seat now held by ‘Sen.
George H. Bender.

Although party reguiars view

, Lausche as a maverick, he has
been the greatest Democratic
vote getter in Ohio in many
years. -

He easily won re-election to
the governorship in 1952 while
President TEisenhower carried
the state by 500.000. Bender
won his Senate seat by a mar-
gin of about 6.000 votes in 1954
to serve the final two years of
the term of the late Sen. Rob-
ert A. Taft.

Despite Bender's victory. the
Democrats in 1954 recaptured
control of the Senate by the
narrow margin of 49 to 47.

Although control of Congress
usually goes to the party win-
ning the presidency, the GOP
can act on no such assumption
in 1956. Most of the Democratic
Seats at stake next year are in
“safe” Democratic states. The
Republicans have proportionate-
ly more seats at stake im the
closely-divided states than the
Demecrats.

The Democrats suffered a,
Similar blow recently when Sen. |
Alan Bible (D-Nev.) announced
he would not seek re-election
next yeam He was considered a
strong candidate in a state
where the GOP has shown in-|
creased strength in the lest;
decade.

Bender responded io Lausche's;
announcement by citing his ree~;
ord of support for the Eisen-
hower administration. He said!
he would campaign in every
Ohio County “io retain for
President Eisenhower and his
program the Senate seat which
may be crucial to the success of}
America in the years directiy |
before us.”

PHOENIX, Ariz., 2 -- A house
heated by a refrigerator operating
backwards was described Thurs-
day at the World Symposium on
Applied Solar Energy,

The refrigerator doesn’t do a
complete job, but it utilizes radia.
tion from a cloudy or overcast sky
as well as sunshine to add to the
heat supply of the dwelling.
| This setup may be helpful in re.
ducing the cost of heating in some
less sunshiry areas, said the twe
engineers who conducted a test
lasting several months at New
Haven, W. Va. They are Philip
Sporn, of New York, president of
the American Gas and Electric
Service Crop., and E, R. Ambrose,
head of the firm's air conditioning
division,

A comniercial refrigerating unit
was used. The freezing unit was
put up on the roof where it could
absorb solar energy, which heated
the refrigerating gas inside it,

The compressor part of the unit
pumped the hot circulating yas te
the condenser in the basement
When the compressor squeezes the
gos & gives up its heat and be
 comes a liquid. The heat is taken
away by piping lhe gas through
coils embedded in a lank of water.
There it heats the water which
then is run through the hot water
heating system of the dwelling,

As the liquified refrigerant gets
cooler it goes back to the {freezing
unit on the roof ta turn back into
gas and pick up another load of
heat.

This system worked on cloudy
and even rainy days, the engineers
isaid, despite its unfavorable laca-
\tion for the absorption of solar
energy. The site is on the banks
ofthe Ohio River.

Between January and May of
this year there were only 10 days
when the setup did not work be-
leause of insufficient solar radia-
tion, the engineers reported. The
joutdoor temperatures ranged from
31 to 50 degrees above zero on rep-
resentative days when efficiency
tests were made,

The refrigerator of course had
to have electricily to operate the
compressor. The hookup was made
{so that the regular heating sys
|tem took over when solar radiation
Twas too low to heat the refrigera

"WASHINGTON (® — Agriculture
Department economists predicted

will decline little if any more on
this year’s crops.

Farm prices now average about
6 per cent below a year ago. Dem-
ocratic leaders have sharply criti-
eized the Eisenhower administra-
tion for the price setbacks, saying
present farm programs are inade-
quate.

In a monthly report on the de-
mand and supply situation for farm
products, the department’s mar-
keting service said that seasonal
price declines may occur for some
commodities. But it said, ‘‘Much
of the general price adjustment to
increased supplies this season have
already taken place.”

Price drops this vear, the re-
port added, largely reflect market
reactions to prospects of a record
 output of agricultural goods.

In a sepa.ate report yesterday,
the Federal Reserve Board's
monthly bulletin blamed the de-
clines on big crops in recent years,
overhanging surpluses. owned by
the government and on the cut-
back in federal price support rates

‘for this season's grain harvest.
- But despite a decrease in farm
income “‘the general financial po-
sition of farmers remains relative-
ly strong,”’ the report added.

The two reports were made pub-
lic as the National Agricultural
Advisory Commission prepared to
wind up a two-day conference to-
day on what steps, if any, it be-
lieves the administration should
take to bolster farm income.

Secretary of Agriculture Benson
has asked the 18-member biparti-
san commission, appointed by
President Eisenhower in 1953. for
its ideas on what the government
might do to put more money into
 farmers’ pockets during the period
of declining prices and downward
adjustments in production from the
high postwar levels.

After yesterday’s closed commis-
sion meeting, a Benson aide said
it appeared necessary to ‘‘buy
time’’ with some temporary farm
assistance program until the ad-
ministration’s new flexible price
price support system has taken
hold.

One major proposal under con-
sideration was that the gov ernment.
pay farmers to take surplus land
out of crop production until price-
depressing surpluses have been re-
duced,

The marketing service report
nuted crops this year appear likely
to be the second largest of record,
while livestock production is ex-
pected to put the combined output
of all farm commodities about 2
per cent above the record volume
produced last year. |

"SUDBURY, Mass. (—The his
toric, centuries-old Wayside Inn
immortalized by poet Henry Wads
worth Longfellow and restored tc
its natural] beauty by the late Hen
ry Ford, was destroyed by flame:
early today.

Two ours after the blaze broke
out in zero temperatures, a fire
official said “The building is a to.
tal loss.’*

The blaze devoured the ram-
bling wooden structure and its con.
tents of valuable antiques. Police
said no one was in the building at
the time.

The historic stopping place on
the old Boston Post Road was built
about 1686 and was known ofiginal-
ly as the Red Tavern. Later it took
on new historic interest when
Longfellow used it as the inspira-
 {tion for his “Tales of a Wayside
jinn,”

The late Henry Ford purchased
|the structure and several other his-
Jtorical buildings in Sudbury in the
Jearly '920’s. The inn was owned by

the For! Foundation and leased
|for the past few years to private
interests.

Ca s *

INCLUDED in the valuable Way-
side Inn antiques destroyed by the
fire was much of the origina) fur-
niture collected by Ford after he
purchasea the site,

A uire official said the blaze be-
gan in the big ballroom and spread
quickly to other parts of the build-
ing. The ballroom was added to
the original building by Ford and
it was there that he re-introduced
the square dance for residents and
visitors.

Officials said it is fractically im-
possible for an outsider to estimate
the financial loss without the know-
ledge of the value of antiques.

Thousands of persons from all
parts of the country visited the
Wayside Inn annually, as well as
the other nearby historical build-
ings, alsn owned by the Ford Foun-
dation

Those include an ancient grist
mi and “the little red school
house,” which local storytellers say
is where the lamb followed Mary
to the classroom.

Only one section of the building
remained standing after the fire—
the east wing, containing a gift

shop, the ancient kitchen and a
cocktail lounge. But they were
badly damaged.

"WASHINGTON, Sept. 3 \P—Union
leaders announced plans today for
a big political push in 1956 while
millions of Americans observed the
Labor Day weekend by taking their
final fling at vacation travel for
this summer.

AFL President George Meany

and CIO President Walter Reuther
both predicted in Labor Day state-
ments that the scheduled merger
of their organizations this Decem-
‘ber will mean a stepup in union
political activity.
- “Once labor is united,’’ Meany
said, ‘we are resolved to intensify
the political activities of labor and
free the trade union movement of
these shackles forged by the poli-
tical power of big business.”

He referred to the Taft-Hartley
Act and what he called “the mis-
named ‘right to work’ laws, which
prohibit union security contracts.”’
now in force in 18 states. In general
these laws ban the union shop, in
which workers must join the union.

Reuther said:

“The new united labor movement
 will, I feel confident, be more ac-
tive than either the CIO or AFL
‘separately, in organizing unorgan-
ized workers into democratic trade
unions; in working with other
groups in the community: in help-
ing to elect the best qualified can-
didates for public office; and in
seeking to bring about the passage
of liberal, forward-looking legisla-
tion in every field.”

— The long Labor Day weekend
brought the usual holiday rush to
railroad, bus ani airline depots and
choked many highwavs leading into
and out of metropolitan centers.
_ The National Safety Council es-
timated that throughout the coun-
‘try 40 million automobiles would
be on the move some time over
‘the weekend, and that 400 persons
would be killed in traffic accidents
between Friday night and mid-
night Monday.

Last year 369 were killed. The
‘Council said its estimate of 400
‘deaths was 100 more than might be
expected on a nonholiday weekend.

in Washington estimated 180,000
persons were leaving the capital
by auto, about 15.000 fewer than

Crease to the hurricane damage
which has left some resort areas
crippled and to fears inspired by
the high death rate of the Fourth
of July weekend.

The Eastern seaboard was cloudy
with some light rainfall in spots,
but the weather was fair over
most of the country. Southern Cal-
ifornia continued to bake in a heat
wave.

Meany, who is to head the com-
bined AFL-CIO. cautioned unions
in his statement to move carefully
to avoid any new legal restraints.
- “In the year ahead,” he said,
“everything that labor does will
be closely watched by those who
are hunting for pretexts to place
further legal chains on unions. Let
us, therefore, live up to the high
ideals of the founders of our move-
ment.”

"WASHINGTON (4) —President
Eisenhower disclosed today he
has been in private correspon-
dence with Soviet Defense Minis-
ter Zhukov within the past three
weeks, He said the correspon-
dence holds out some slim hope
of betterment in the United
States-Soviet Relations.

Eisenhower told of the corre-
spondence at a news conference,
and said he has a feeling world
peace prospects are on the up-
swing,

As to Red China, the President
said the United States is willing
to confer alone with the Commu-
nists regarding a Formosa area
cease-fire but not on matters af-
fecting Nationalist China.

In saying he feels peace pros-
 pects are improving, Eisenhower
said it is also possible, however,
to balance every encouraging de-
velopment—such as Russia’s will-
ingness to agree on an Austrian
peace treaty—with an adverse
development, stich as the Red
Chinese air buildup in the vicini-
ty of Formosa.

He said that at this time he
sees no reason for a meeting be-
tween himself and the British,
French and Russian heads of
state as a result of the Austrian
treaty negotiations. But he said
such a meeting is always possi-
ble, +

the word.

Rainstorms lashed Pacific coast-
al areas and floods threatened
many areas.

Cold weather clung to Northern
states although there was some
relief from the icy blasts of the
last several days.
 It was below zero again today
over most of New England and
wide sections of New York state.
Coldest spot early this morning
was Messena, N.Y., which report-
ed 30 degrees below zero.

Below - freezing temperatures
extended from southern North Car-
olina westward to eastern Okla-
homa, northeast Kansas and north-
west to northeast Montana.

Fairly warm Pacific air contin-
ued to give the Rockies and West-
ern Plains generally mild weather
for the first day of winter, with
readings in the 40s in Colorado,
Wyoming and parts of central
Montana.

The heavy rain and wind storms
struck areas from central Califor-
nia to western Oregon and Wash-
ington. Rainfall which measured
from 2 to 5 inches in western Ore-
gon blocked roads, closed some
schools and ‘forced evacuation of
some families living in the low-
lying areas.

The rain in northern California,
the heaviest in 15 years, flooded
rivers in northwest counties,
closed a dozen highways, flooded
sections of two communities and
cut off ground travel in the north
coastal area. Families were forced

nate polio in this country,

The President made his state-
ment of confidence at news con-

the inoculation program.

He said it was a doctors’ decl-
sion to double-check the manufac-

a postponement in inoculations.
As for the efficacy of the vaccine
itself, Eisenhower said he believes
absolutely it can do the job for
which it was intended.

He said there have been 52 cases
of polio in five million injections

jwhether there is any relationship
of these cases to the vaccinations.

of confirmed cases among those

| a Chicago Negro boy rested
their defense at 10:22 a.m, est
today,

The defense finished its case
after presenting six character wit-
nesses, three each for 24-year-old
Roy Bryant and his 36-year-old
half-brother, John W, Milam. At-
torneys are expected to begin ar-
guments to the jury before noon, |

Defendants did not testify.

Circuit Judge Curtis Swango
again overruled defense motions |
for a directed verdict of innocent. |

The judge then ordered a brief
recess before state prosecutors be-
gan their final summation to the
jury.

In Mississippi, the state opens
and closes the final arguments.
The defense argument is sand-
wiched between the state’s argu-
ments.

The half-brothers are accused of
murdering Emmett Louis Till, 14-
year-old Negro, and dumping his
weighted body into the muddy Tal-
lahatchie River.

Defense attorneys appeared con-
fident the all-male, all-white jury
would free Bryant and Milam—
principally, they felt, as a result |
of testimony by three defense wit-
nesses attacking the identification
of the battered body as that of Till. |

natic moment yesterday after- | ¢

jicture of the body, :
 She said it was her son “beyond

But three defense witnesses eas

Sheriff H. C, Strider of Tallahat-
chie County said the body ap-
peared to have been in the river
“‘at least 10 days, if not 15.”

A country undertaker, H. D. Ma-

lone, estimated the time in the
water at 10-25 days.
Dr, L. B, Otken, a physician
from nearby Greenwood, put the
time at from eight days to two
weeks,

Defense attorneys asked Dr. Ot-
ken: “In your opinion, could any-
one have identified the body?”

Dr Otken answered: “I don't
think so.’

Q. If he had been his brother,
could he? A. I doubt it,

Q. His mother? A. I doubt it,
All three witnesses said the body
was bloated and badly y Bond

posed,

This was a critical point because
only three days elapsed from the
time Till was taken from his un-
cle’s home until the body was
found by a teen-aged fisherman,

The defense concentrated its
questioning on identification, the
heart of the state's case. If the
state failed in jurors’ eyes to prove
Till was murdered, Bryant and
Milam could not be convicted of
Killing him.

Earlier, Chatham said the state
would not seek the death penalty

The United States, Britain.and
France are preparing a strongly
worded resolution condemning -Is-

Syrian positions near the Sea of
Galilee, informed sources said to-
day.

The Western Big Three were ex-
pected to present the resolution
at this afternoon's session of the
Security Council when Syria an-
nounced it- would. demand eco-
nomic sanctions.against the Jewish
state,

Informed sources said the West-
ern Big. Three, who have- been
charged with maintaining peace in
the Middle East, would not go
along with Syria’s demand for
sanctions that would: cut off Is-
rael’s' financial..support from
abroad.

The council already had before
it a report from Maj. Gen, E.L.M.
Burns, chief U.N. Palestine truce
supervisor, calling the Israel ac-
tion a “deliberate violation’’ of. the
armistice agreement and warning
that it might bring on ‘full scale
hostilities.”.

Burns referred in his report to
last year’s attacks against Egyp-
tian ferces at Kibya and Gaza for
which the council condemned Js-
rael and said like those, ‘the Ti-
berias (Galilee) incident has been!
explained. by Isrdel..as.a ret:

“In these three cases,” he said,
“Israel forces have acted by sur-
prise, and, after striking a heavy
blow, they have returned to their
base.. There is, however, a risk
in such retaliatory action, namely,
that the attackers may not be able
to limit the extent of the. operation

"CLEVELAND, April 27- (AP) -
Marilyn Sheppard’s slayer was bit-
ten on the hand and left at least
one drop of his blood at the scene
of her murder, a laboratory expert
said today,

The man who killed her was left-
handed, and he intended a sexuai
attack on her, the expert added.

Dr. Paul Kirk, professor of
criminalistics at the University
of California, made these points
in an affidavit filed in Common
Pleas Court.

It was one of seven affidavits
offered to support a motion for a
new trial for Dr. Samuel H. Shep-
pard, on the claim new evidence
has been found.

Last Dec. 21 the handsome 31-
year-old osteopath from suburban
Bay Village was convicted of sec-
ond degree murder and sentenced
to life imprisonment for the July
4 bindgeoning of his pregnant wife.

His chief attorney, William J.
Corrigan, told trial Judge Edward
Blythin the affidavits show two
blood stains were removed from
a wardrobe door in Mrs. Shep-
Partl’s bedroom by Dr. Virgil Haws,

- pathologist at Bay View hospital,
where the defendant practiced.

They were sent to Dr. Kirk for
analysis and one of them proved
to be “of extreme importance,” said
Corrigan,

* * *

DR. KIRK’S AFFIDAVIT said a
one-inch blood stain from the door
belonged to neither of the Shep-
pards,

Asst. County Prosecutor Saul
Danaceau, who teck part in the
trial last fall, asked Judge Blythin
for time to prepare answering af-
fivadits, na

Corrigan asked that th hearing
be recessed for only one day, to
permit, an early return to Califor-
nia by Dy, Kirk, who was present
to testify.

The judge said the hearing would
be resumed at his call, probably
Thursday morning.

* * +

Corrigan said the other six
affidavits—including one from
the defendant—all were in-
tended to support Dr, Kirk’s.
In the main, they were intended
to show the Sheppard home had
not been changed between the
time the state released it and
the time Dr, Kirk made his ex-
amination there last January.

As damages mounted down-

this weekend. Many-of the areas
hit generally suffer damages when
the river overflows.

Cincinnati braced for the flood

Sixty-four Manchester businesses

"SUDBURY, Mass. (2) — The
historic. centuries-old Wayside
Inn, immortalized by poet
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow
and restored to its natural
beauty by the late Henry Ford
was destroyed by flames early
today.

Two hours after the blaze
broke out in zero temperatures,
a fire official said “The building
is a total loss.”

The blaze devoured the ram-

bling wooden structure and its
contents of valuable antiques,
Police said no one was in the
building at the time.
The historic stopping place on
the old Boston Post Rd was
built about 1686 and was known
originally as the Red Tavern..

The inn was immortalized in
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow’s
“Tales of a Wayside Inn,” and
the grandfather clock of which
Longfellow wrote was among
the priceless antiques which
were destroyed.

In the centuries past, such
famous men as George Wash-
ington and Gen. LaFayette had
stayed at the inn, lecated out-
side Boston. |

The late Henry Ford  pur-|
chased the structure and several
other historical buildings in Sud-
bury in the early 1920's. The
inn was owned by the Ford
Foundation and leased for the
past few years to private inter-
ests.

Included in the valuable Way-
side Inn antiques destroyed by
the fire was much of the orig-
inal furniture collected by Ford
after he purchased the site.

A fire official said the blaze
began in the big ballroom and
spread quickly to other parts of
the building. The ballroom was
added t» the original building
by Ford and it was there that
ne «reintroduced the square
dance for residents and visitors.

Officials said it is practically
mpossible for an outsider to
estimate the fmancfal joss with-
mut the Knowledge of the value
xt antiques.

Thousands of persons from all
parts of the country visited the
Wayside Inn annually, as. weil

"WASHINGTON (®) — Postmaster
General Summerfield Tuesday
asked Congress for postage rate
increases designed to bring in over
332 million dollars a year.

At the same time, he proposed
a 129 million dollar a year salary
increase for the 500,000 postal
workers — a 5 per cent hike for
all, slightly more for sdme.

- Among other things, Summer-
field requests that the first class
letter rate, local and out-of-town,
‘be upped from three to four cents
for the first ounce only, additional

ounces remaining at three cents.

A similar proposal last year
would have restricted the increase
to four cents solely to out of town
mail,

Other Increases

Summerfield said the new four-
cent proposal alone would raise
237 million dollars in new revenue
‘and go a long way’’ toward elim-
inating the postal deficit, current-
ly running between 300 and 400
million dollars a year.

The Summerfield proposals
would provide these other in-
creases in mail rates:

Domestic air mail — An increase
on the first ounce only from six
to seven cents, for an additional
yield of 14 million dollars a year.

Second class mail (principally

"WASHINGTON (®—Secretary of
State Dulles’ trip to the Far East
apparently convinced him the
United States and Communist Chi-
na are heading toward a military
showdown — probably over For-
mosa.

In a nationwide broadcast last
night, Dulles issued two solemn
warnings:

1. To the Chinese Reds he said
U. S. sea and air forces in the
area are “now equipped with new
and powerful weapons of preci-
sion, which can utterly destroy
military targets without endanger-
ing unreleated civilian centers.”

2. To the American people he
said the whole defense system for
free Asia will fail unless they are
willing to use their “greater force’
in response to a military challenge
from Communist China.

Dulles’ tone was grim although
he reported progress on strength-
ening the Southeast Asian alliance
whose conference at Bangkok
Thailand, took him aboard,

Dulles promised continued arm:
aid for Far Eastern countries
Without giving details, he project-
ed U. S. cooperation toward im-
proving economic conditions. He
termed subversion the greates
danger in Southeast Asia, bu
voiced belief the threat would di-
minish when such countries a:
Viet Nam understand that thei
allies “have the power, and _ the
will, to strike down an open armec
aggressor.”

One theme dominated Dulles
talk. It was that the free, friend];
peoples of Asia are mainly de-
pendent for their security on “mo:
bile Allied power” spearheaded b;
U. S. sea and air power. And he
said if they think that the Unitec
States will not fight if troubl
comes then they will lose confi

| dence and free Asia will fall apart

Dulles did not say specificall;
that the showdown which he fore.

|sees will come over Formosa. Bu
Jin several key sentences he statec
j}his view this way: : :
| “We hope that the present mili
| tary activities of the Chinese Com
|munists are not in fact the firs
|stage of an attack against For.
mosa and the Pescadores. We hop
that a ceasefire may be attain

The summer of 1955, which will
stand on the record books as one
of the hottest in the nation’s his-
tory, ended Friday.

A heat wave was still hanging on
in the South. But fall got off to a
blustery start in Canada, where
the worst autumn snow storm in
five years blocked highways in
Southern Alberta.

Officially, summer was to bow
out and fall was to begin at
exactly 2:42 p.m. EST. This was
the moment of Autumnal Equinox,
when the center of the sun is
directly over the equator.

Most of the nation was appro-
priately cool for the beginning of
fall, with brisk Canadian air knif-
ing as far south as the Texas
Panhandle.

But summer heat stayed on in
the Gulf states and Southwest
desert. Highs of 99 were registered
Thursday at Yuma, Ariz., and
Needles, Calif.. and temperatures
were in the 90's as far north as
 Southern Illinois and Indiana.

In Alberta, meanwhile, nearly
five and a half inches of snow
blocked highways and halied traf-
fic in and around Calgary. The
snow was whipped by 20-mile-per-
hour winds and power lines were
knocked down in nearby areas. At
least one death was blamed on
the storm.

Far to the south, a new hurri-
cane churned through the Carib-
bean and the de&th toll of Hurri-
cane Hilda continued to rise.

The new hurricane, dubbed
Janet, was only a little more than
a day old, but already carried 115-
mile-per-hour winds It rammed
through the sparsely - populated
Windward Islands and was headed
in the general direction of Central
America Friday.

-In Mexico, floods swollen by
Hurricane Hilda began to recede
around Tampico, but washed up 21
more bodies which brought the
death toll to 204. At least 370
more persons were missing and
| believed dead.

"SUDBURY, Mass. — (® —
The historic, centuries - old
Wayside Inn, immortalized
by poet Henry Wadsworth
Longfellow and restored to
its natural beauty by the late
Henry Ford, was destroyed
by flames early today.

Two hours after the blaze broke
out in zero temperatures, a fire
official said “The building is a
total loss.’

The blaze devoured the rambling
wooden structure and its contents
of valuable antiques. Police said
{no one was in the building at the
time,

Built About 1686

The historic stopping place on
the Boston Post Road was built
about 1686 and was known original-
ly as the Red Tavern. Later it took
on new historic interest when
{Longfellow used it as the inspira-
jtion for his “Tales of a Wayside
Inn.”

The late Henry Ford purchased
the structure and several other his-
torical buildings in Sudbury in the
early 1920’s. The inn was owned
by the Ford Foundation and leased
for the past few years to private
interests.

Included in the valuable Way-
side Inn antiques destroyed by the
fire was much of the original fur-
niture collected by Ford after he
purchased the site.

Square Dance Site

A fire official said the blaze be-
gan in the big ballroom and spread
quickly to other parts of the build-
ing. The ballroom was added to
the original building by Ford and
it was there that he re-introduced
the square dance for residents and
visitors.

Officials said it is practically im-
; possible for an outsider to estimate
the financial loss without the
| knowledge of the value of antiques.

Thousands of persons from all
parts of the country visited the
Wayside Inn annually, as well as
the other nearby historical build-
ings, also owned by the Ford Foun-
dation.

Those include an ancient grist
mill and “the little red school
house,” which local storytellers say
is where the lamb followed Mary
to the classroom.

Only one section of the building
remained standing after the fire-—
the east wing, containing a gift
shop, the ancient kitchen and a

"DES MOINES. (#) - A major
transportation proposal under
which the Circle Express Co. of
Waterloo proposed to furnish a
highway express service to 220
cities and towns in lowa was re-
jected today by unanimous vote
of the Iowa state commerce com-
mission.

The firm wanted to establish a
motor freight service which would
give door-to-door delivery on ship-
ments of 100 pounds or less with-
out inter-line shipments with any
other carrier. It proposed a terr!-
tory roughly taking in about the
northwest half of lowa.

Objectors to the proposal in-
‘cluded railroads, other motor
freight carriers, the Railway Ex-
press Co., bus companies and rail-
read brotherhoods. |
Supporters of the plan included
numerous chambers of commerce,
wholesalers, jobbers and manu-
facturers.

In turning down the applica-
tion, the commission said: |

“Any proposal of this size —
and scope, unless unequivocally —

convincing, should not he |

granted as the commission can-
not permit any applicant to in-
dulge in an experiment which
may siphon away an important
source of revenue and thereby
jeopardize lowa's common car-
rier system.” |

that segregation in public schools
is unconstitutional.

WASHINGTON (7 — Sen. Hill
(D-Ala) said today there was
“absolutely no question’? but that
Congress would quickly ‘approve
President Eisenhower’s request
for. 28 million dollars to pay for
anti-polio vaccine for children
whose parents can’t afford the
shots.

Hill, chairman of. the Senate
-Labor and Public Welfare Com-
mittee, said in an interview he ex-
pected Eisenhower's companion
request for two million dollars for
more inspectors to police vaccine
output to go through as soon as
Congress could get around to con-
sidering the matter.

Otherwise! Hill voiced reserva-
tions about the administration's
new 11-point program for volun-
tary allocations and controls over
distribution of the Salk polio vac-
cine. Secretary of Welfare Hobby
outlined the program to the com-
mittee yesterday after it had been
approved by the President.

_ Hill said the program ‘‘very
clearly”? was not ‘detailed or defi-
nite.”

Committee Democrats indicated
by their questions and comments
at yesterday’s hearing that they
are far from sold on the adminis-
tration’s plan to make sure, by
| voluntary methods, that supplies
of the still scarce vaccine get to
the most susceptible age groups in
sufficient quantities and that dis-
tribution is carried out equitably.
There were some new Democratic
charges of “bungling.”

But Republican members of the
committee defended the adminis-
tration’s handling of the problem
and congratulated Mrs. Hobby for
the job she has done.

Although the administration is
opposed to compulsory contro}
over vaccine. distribution and
price, Sen. Ives (R-NY) indicated
he was inclined toward supporting
proposals for standby controls.

“I'd rather have federal controls
available than to run into a situa-
tlon where they need it and don’t
have it,’’ Ives said in a separate
interview..

Hill said he felt it would be wise
to have standby controls ‘‘so the
power would be there if needed.”

Sen. H. Alexander Smith (R-NJ),
senior Republican on the commit-
tee, said he was ‘“‘reserving final
judgment’”’” on the question of
standby control powers.

While under questioning yester-
day, Mrs. Hobby declined to agree
with some committee members
that. standby control powers might
be helpful.
| But she did concede at a later
point that “if this program should
break down, if a maldistribution
| should take plack...of course the
‘federal government should be in
control,”

Meanwhile, mass ineculations of
school children were getting un-
derway again after a week-long
halt suggested by the government
to permit public health service
teams to recheck vaccine manu-
facturers’ safety standards.

As of yesterday, the Health
Service said it had confirmed 73
post-inoculation polio cases.

The Health Service has empha-
sized that no connection has been
established between the Salk vac-
| cine and the’ polio cases.

“The council expressed the hope
that there would be a cessation
of hostilities in the Far East and
‘no further resort to force, since

S. Walker, 86, who died at her

Walker was the mother of the late
Lt. Gen. Walton H. Walker, who
was killed in a jeep accident in
Korea in 1950, when he was in
command of the Eighth Army in
that area.

Mrs. Walker had been in ill
health for a number of years, and
broke her hip in a fall at her
home a few months ago. Services
were held at Heartfield chapel,
conducted by Rev. E. C. Carter,
pastor of the Methodist church,
assisted by Rev. James Basden of
the First Baptist church. Burial
was in North Belton cemetery.

Pallbearers were Harris Ham-

port; Arthur E. Collier, Sr., June
ykes of Temple; and Byron Ham-
mersmith, James K. Evetts, Harry
Blair, Dr. J. W. Pittman, Clem C.
Countess and Rex Clements.

|

Mrs. Walker was born in Belton
Feb. 16, 1869, the daughter of
Capt. and Mrs. A. J. Harris, pio-
neers from Mississippi. She was
educated in Belton and in a school
for young women in Athenaeum,
Tenn.

She was married in 1888 to Sam
S. Walker, a Belton merchant,
who was the son of Maj. and Mrs.
Benjamin Walton Walker of Vir-
ginia.

Though she lived all of her life
in Belton, Mrs. Walker’s travels
took her all over the world, and
she spent many months in China
and the Orient a number of years
ago. In college she was a class-
mate of Mrs. John Nance Garner,
late wife of the former vice-presi-
dent of the United States, and
was a guest of the Garners at the
inauguration of President Roose-
velt.

She was a member of the Belton
Methodist church, of the Woman’s
Wednesday club, the United
Daughters of the American Revo-
lution, an associate member of
the Texas Organization of Coloni-
al Dames, and was a member-at-
large of the Daughters of the War
of 1812.

Her family is closely connected

Warned by its Palestine truce chief

The council planned to take up
the explosive Arab-Israel issue
again this afternoon. Before it was
a report from the scene by Cana-
 ‘dian Maj. Gen. E. L. M. Burns,
the truce supervisor, branding Is-
rael's Dec, 11 attack on Syrian
“gun positions along the Sea of Gali-

lation, a

Chief Syrian Delegate Ahmed
Shukairy was expected to make a
new request that the council apply
economic sanctions against Israel
and even oust her from the VU. N.
if necessary to prevent a repeti-
tion of the raid.

Israel Explains

Israel explained the attack as
she has others in the past—that it
was made in retaliation for past
Syrian attacks and in an effort to
prevent future ones, Israeli Am-
bassador Abba Eban circulated
among council members what his
government claims are photostatic
copies of Syrian army orders to
fire on Israeli fishing boats on the
‘Sea of Galilee, along which Jesus
Christ spent much of his life,

A Syrian army spokesman in
Damascus denied any such instruc-
tions had been issued.

Israel claims all the water area
of the inland lake. Syrian territory
begins only a few miles back from
the northeast shore and commands
the eastern part of the inland sea.

Since Shukairy complained to the
council last Friday, Arab dele-
gates have Ween drumming up a
campaign to throw Israel out of
the world organization, But there
appeared little chance they could
muster enough support for such
drastic action.

The council was not expected to
go ‘farther than an expression of
censure, the action it has taken in
‘similar cases in the past.

WASHINGTON (AP) —~ President Eisenhower, accom-;,
panied by Secretary of State Dulles, arrived back in Washing- |
‘ton Monday night after @ six-day trip through three oe
‘New England states. |

Dulles had fiown from Washington to Bangor, Me., :
Monday afternoon to meet the President and return with him
 here. |

They used the return flight to
have a “couple. of hours of quiet,
talk” about international affairs. |

Both men looked tired when
they stepped down from the plane. :

President Eisenhower, first off,
the plane. left immediately by car
for the White House. Dullés de+
parted for his home a few mate
later.

While on his trip, the pragieus

fished, played golf and made a
‘series of folksy, informal speeches. |
- The President told a police esti-
mated crowd of 15,000 at Bangor.
just before leaving for Washington
that Dulles “‘has come up to insure
that my vacation would end and
give me a lecture on the way
back.”
- Before boarding the Columbine
at Washington for the flight to
Bangor, Dulles told newsmen he
planned to talk with the President
about the shooting down Wednes-
day of an American Navy patrol
plane in the Bering Straits between
Alaska and Soviet Siberia, and al-
so about foreign policy develop-
ments.

Of the Russian answer to a
strong American protest, an ex-
pression of regret and an offer
to pay half the damages, Dulles
commented:

“They have not offered all that
we consider appropriate under the
circumstances.”’
 Dulles emphasized his unsched-
aed meeting here with the Presi
dent involved ‘no emergency of
any kind.""

The President came here from
Skowhegan, where he spoke at the
fairgrounds and attended a Maine
‘clambake at the home of Sen. Mar-
garet Chase Smith (R-Maine).

Dulles flew here from Washing-
‘ton and greeted Eisenhower on his
arrival at 8:22 p. m. EDT.

- In the fairgrounds speech, the
‘President said America’s goal is
the winning of a ‘‘permanent peace
and not merely an uneasy cessa-
tion of the guns.’”

Sen. Smith and traditionally Re-
‘publican Maine’s Democratic Gov.
‘Edmund S. Muskie met the Presi-
dent on the outskirts of the city,
which is Mrs. Smith’s home town.
‘Maine’s other Republiran senator,
Frederick Payne had accompanied
Fisenhower from Lake Parmache-
inee in the state’s north woods.

| The governor told Efsenhower he
‘was welcome ‘‘in full measure.’

| The President, concluding a Six.
‘day tour of Vermont, New Hamp.-
shire and Maine, said that his tour
‘had left him still convinced that
Americans, in the basic aspiration
and hopes for the future, are
j united,

| ‘We want peace in the world,”
‘he declared. ‘‘We want prosperity
jat home, a prosperity that is wide-
ily shared, with everybody happy
‘in his job.

“We have come to realize these

‘cannot have prosperity without

days. Classes met briefly on Monday
afternoon for assignments.

Not a single cadet was left on the

campus during the holidays. The boys
scattered, far and wide to their homes
in this country and in foreign coun-
tries. They all report a wonderful
|vacation and they. returned feeling
somewhat tired and sleepy. At. least

"WASHINGTON, July 7 — (INS)
— The House Labor Committee
voted today to increase the national
minimum wage from the present
75 cents to one dollar an hour,
effective next March 1,

President Ignored

The House group followed the
action taken by the Senate June 8
and ignored President Eisenhow-
er's recommendation for a 90-cent
hourly scale.

The committee also rejected rec-
ommendations by labor organiza-
tions that the wage be set at $1.25
an_ hour,

Democratic leaders predicted the
House will approve the one dollar
figure and that President Ejisen-
hower will sign the legislation.

Affects Million

About one million, 300 thousand
workers employed in industries
which prigage in interstate busi-
ness would be affected by any in-
crease in the minimum wage to 60
cents or more.

Approximately one million of
them are employed by manufac-
turing firms, while the remainder
are in such fields as banking, in-
surance, wholesale trade and com-
munications,

Eisenhower also recommended
that the minimum wage law be
broadened to cover an additional
two million, 100 thousand workers

"SUDBURY, Mass. — The his-
toric, century-old Wayside Inn,
immortalized by poet Henry
Wadsworth Longfellow and re-
stored to its natural beauty by
the late Henry Ford, was de-
Stroyed by flames early today.

Two hours after the blaze
broke out in zero temperatures,
a fire official said “The building
is a total loss.” \

The blaze devoured the ram-
bling wooden structure and its
contents of valuable antiques.
Police said no one was in the
building at the time.
| The historic stopping place on
the old Boston Post Road was
built about 1686 and was known
originally as the Red Tavern.
Later it took on new historic in-
terest when Longfellow used it
as the inspiration for his “Tales
of a Wayside Inn.” °

The late Henry Ford purchas-
ed the structure and several
other historical buildings in Sud-
bury in the early 1920's. The inn
was owned by the Ford Founda- |
tion and leased for the past few
years to private interests.
Included in the valuable Way-
Side Inn antiques destroyed by
 the fire was much of the original
furniture collected by Ford after
he purchased the site.

A. fire official said the blaze
began in the big ballroom and
spread quickly to other parts of
the building. The ballroom was
added to the original building by
Ford and it was there that he
re-introduced the square dance
for residents and visitors,

Officials said it is practically
impossible for an outsider to
estimate the financial loss with-
out the knowledge of the value
of antiques.

Thousands of persons from all
parts of the country visited the
Wayside Inn annually, as well as
the other nearby historical build-
ings. also owned by the Ford
Foundation.

Those include an ancient grist
mill and “the little red school
house,” which local storytellers
say is where the lamb folllowed
Mary to the classroom.
| Only one section of the build-
ing remained standing after the
fire—the east wing, containing a
gift shop, the ancient kitchen
and a cocktail lounge, But they
were badly damaged. : :

| WASHINGTON — (P) -- The
‘united States faces today greater
jrisk of war with Red China than
;at any time since the Korean

War ended 18 months ago.

President Eisenhower and Sec-

retary of State Dulles are cone

vinced that taking this risk,

|however, affords the best long-
jrange hope for peace in the Far
} Bast, It can be stated on excel-
‘iIent authority that both believe
strongly in the probability of
peace. ;

In his message to Congress yes-
Li terday, Kisenhower put the issue
ti} squarely up to Red China: If
2lihe Reds Start an attack aimed
Stat conquering Formosa, the

United States is prepared to
J! fight: if and when the Reds are
Blready for peace, the United
0; States is prepared to make peace.

The decisions which underlay
t this policy are decisions of a
“liind (hat the administration in
“ithe past has avoided, apparently
in hope that the Reds would not
press the issue to a showdown.

Several events this month fo~
s| cused the problems of Formosa,
e|the Chinese Nationalist seat of
e/ government, so sharply that ad-
ministration leaders decided &
more clearly defined policy was
needed. Among them:

1, Leaders in the new Demo-
cratic-controlled Congress want-
ed to know the full extent of
sifirm and potential American
‘commitments in the area.

9, The Communists engaged in
ta steady buildup of forces appo-
's{site Formosa and Peiping kept
1e, repeating her intent to conquer
ay; the island.
~~| 3. The Reds displayed effec-
iy, tive striking power in capturing
‘last week the small Nationalist-
held island of Yikiangshan.
| 4, Chiang Kai-shek appealed
\for U. S. help when the Reds
stepped up attacks on the
y-|Tachen Islands, near Yikiang-
1t{shan but more important thar
it, The Tachens, 200 miles nortt
of Formosa, are close to th
Communist mainland.

The expression of SU ppor'

His discovery was revealed in a

The California criminologist

‘charged that the state’s circum-

this theory is “‘substantiated by
the position of Mrs. Sheppard’s

"WASHINGTON —A—
Sens. Chavez (D-N.M.) and
Robertson (D-Va.) accused the
Air Force of wasting “millions
of dollars” on its construction
programs in England and Alas-
ka.

The charges were raised at a
Senate Appropriations Subcom-
‘mittee hearing as Air Force
spokesmen began explaining
requests for nearly 15 billion
dollars. These Air Force funds
jhave already been approved by
jthe House.
| Gives an Example
| Chavez, subcommittee chair
man, said an example of wast
and inefficiency was a repor
to the committee that betwee:
10 and 15 million dollars hat
been wasted on the Air Force
aati program in the
United Kingdom by “needless
repetition of planning.”

: “Much greater sums have
been wasted in trying to exe-
cute these imperfect plans,” he
added. :

Sen. Robertson broke in to
say he had been informed that
the multi-million dollar waste
in Great Britain was only “a
small part of what was lost in
Alaska.”

Says Flying Precarious

He said Air Force projects
there cost “a hundred million
dollars more than was contem-
plated.”

Robertson said the annual
“maintenance cost on these
Alaskan projects is excessive”
and that “fog and below zero
temperatures made flying from
them almost impossible.”

as one of the hottest in the
nation’s history, ended today.
The weather was cloudy and
mild in Racine, but a heat wave
still was hanging on in the
south. But fall got off to a
blustery start in Canada, where
the worst autumn snow storm
in five years blocked highways
in southern Alberta.
Officially, summer bowed
out and fall began at exactly
‘1:42 p.m. Racine time. This
was the moment of autumnal
equinox, when the center of
‘the sun is directly over the
Equator.
_ Most of the nation was ap-
-propriately cool for the begin-
ning of fall, with brisk Cana-
dian air knifing as far south as
‘the Texas Panhandle.

Lingers in Gulf

But summer heat stayed on
in the Gulf states and south-
west desert. Highs of 99 were
registered Thursday at Yuma,
Ariz., and Needles, Calif., and
‘temperatures were in the 90s
as far north as southern Illinois
and Indiana.
| In Alberta, meanwhile, near-
ly 514 inches of snow blocked
highways and halted traffic in
and around Calgary. The snow
was whipped by 20-mile-per-
‘hour winds and power lines
were knocked down in many
areas. At least one death was
‘blamed on the storm.
| Far to the south, a new hur-
ricane churned through the
| Caribbean and the death toll
 of hurricane Hilda continued tc
rise.

The new hurricane, dubbec
Janet, was only a little more
than a day old, but already car
ried 115-mile-per-hour winds
It rammed through the sparse]
populated Windward Island:
and was headed in the genera
direction of Central America.

| Find 21 More Bodies

_ In Mexico, floods swollen by
hurricane Hilda began to re
cede around Tampico, bu
washed up 21 more bodie:
which brought the death toll t«

 
 204. At least 370 more per-
sons were missing and believed
dead.

The summer which ended to-
day had been the hottest on
record in many parts of the
country. Successive heat waves
broke record after record and
the hot weather lasted far into
September.

Racine reported 90 degree
temperatures on 32 days — 6
days short of an all-time
record.

- The season's worst heat
wave was in the Los Angeles
area, where more than a week
of 100-plus scorchers caused
scores of deaths. Prolonged

heat set new records in Mil-

TAIPEI, Formosa—(?}—Two
top-level U, S. envoys left to-
day on the long trip from
Scholars’ Forest to the White
House to report on their mili-
tary-diplomatic emergency
mission to Formosa.

Admiral Arthur W. Radford,
chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff, and Walter S. Rob-
ertson, assistant secretary of
state,: maintained the same
tight-lipped silence they had
kept during their three days
at President Chiang Kai-
shek’s suburban retreat.

An American official said
they had come to strengthen
—not weaken—Far East de-
fenses. The official, wha re-
fused to be identified, said this
information was “100 per cent
accurate.”

The impression was strong
that the two visitors had not
advised the Nationalists to
 abandon Quemoy and the Mat-
sus. Nationalist sources in-
sisted that neither had sug-
guested it.

Nationajist newspapers con-
tinued to editorialize against
any suggestion that Quemoy
of Matsu be given up.

Nationalist fears that Rob-
ertson and Radford had come
‘seeking agreement on giving
up the offshore islands in or-
der to seek a cease-fire with
the Communists In the For-
mosa Strait seemed to be sub-
siding.

But disappointment and bit-
terness replaced these. earlier
apprehensions in the wake of
Secretary of State Dulles’ an-
nouncement of a new open-
door policy toward cease-fire
talks with Red China.

any contact with the Reds will

"| BUENOS AIRES # — Maj. Gen.

Eduardo Lonardi made a trium-
_phal entry into Buenos Aires today
to take control of the provisional
_gavernment of Argentina on
_half of the victorious rebels.
| The airfield in suburban Paler-
/mo was tightly guarded by troops
and police armed with machine-
guns. A red carpet was rolled out
pew Lonardi. Thousands of citizens

ns ata around the airport limits,
ring wildly and waving flags.
The military guards held them
_ back firmly but made no move to
dampen their enthusiasm.
| The planes which accompanied

_Lonardi from Cordoba were freshly
| painted with a huge V for victory
and with the cross—a reminder
| that the revolution was caused in
| part by President Juan D. Peron’s
‘feud with the Catholic Church.
| Before leaving Cordoba, Lonardi

spoke of the possibility Peron

might be brought to trial.

“We want to make it impossible
for him to again damage the coun-
try,”’ Lonardi told a news confer-
ence. “In case he is brought to
trial, the ex-president will present
himself as any other Argentine and
enjay all the guarantees and rights
established in the constitution.”’

He did not expand on the pos-
sibility of:a trial, but if this took
place it would be on criminal
charges. The asylum granted Per-
on by Paraguay would prevent his
arrest as a political prisoner.

The revolution leader’s entry in-
to Buenos Aires was preceded by
an order from the provisional gov-
ernment for the arrest of all
Peron supporters in the national
Congress. Earlier, the new regime
had dissolved the Congress, in
which 34 Senate seats and all but
12 places in the 155-member lower
house.

Violence flared here and in Ro-
sario, Argentina’s second largest
city, as students and other foes of
the ousted dictator moved to eradi-
cate evidences of Peron’s power.
Pictures and busts of Peron and
his late wife Eva were torn from

walls and destroyed. : J

At Rosario, several people were
beaten up when Peronists attacked

a group cheering a column of
troops. The soldiers restored order
and many Peron supporters were
arrested.

The arrest of Peronista con-

gressmen was said to be for ‘‘in-
vestigation’’ and nat as a retalia-
tory move. It was regarded as one
of the strongest measures by the
new government to ward off possi-
ble trouble from disgruntled Peron
supporters.

New snow flurries struck

The fourth death, that of 76-

this morning in Spanish Fork
Canyon when two cars skidded
into each other. All three earlier
fatalities had been blamed on
similar mishaps.

The Weather Bureau predicted
that the snow would continue, at
least in northwestern Utah,
through tomorrow morning, but
‘that temperatures would become

"TAIPEI, Formosa, Jan. 25—UP
—Communist artillery bombarded
the Tachen Islands Tuesday in an
apparent warning to the U. S. Sev-
enth fleet that an attempt to evac-

within range of Red guns.

The Communist reconnaissance

group 200 miles north of Formosa
in what was expected to be a pre-
lude to another massive bombing
attack such as the one that soften-
ed up nearby Yikangshan for a
Red invasion. They also obvious-

The two admirals also were ex-
