Three Guerrillas Hanged
 ",,"DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) — The Syrian
government hanged three pro-Palestinian
guerrillas at dawn today in swift
retribution for a bloody raid on a
Damascus hotel just 24 hours earlier.

A fourth guerrilla and four te
were killed and 34 hostages were
in a seven-hour battle for the Semiramis
Hotel in the most daring Palestinian at-

tack yet in Syria.
The three surviving terrorists were
hanged in a square facing the

luxury hotel. Their bodies, clad only in
white tunics, were left dangling in nooses
for six hours as thousands of Syrians
pressed around the gallows and climbed to
balconies and rooftops to see the victims.

The guerrillas called themselves the
“Black June’ group and apparently were
protesting Syria's military intervention
that began last June in the Lebanese civil
war.

Before they were executed, the three
went on Syrian state television and said
they belonged to Al Fatah, the biggest
Palestinian guerrilla group. They also said
they had been trained in Iraq, which has
supported radical Arab organizations and
has denounced the Syrian role in Lebanon.

But in Beirut, a spokesman for the
Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO),
the Palestinian umbrella group headed by
Yasir Arafat, denied that any PLO
members were responsible. Arafat also
heads Al Fatah, which is considered to be
less radical than some Palestinian
guerrilla units.
 A Syrian government statement said the
four hostages who died Sunday were killed
by the terrorists. Three of the slain
hostages were women, and witnesses said
all were Arabs. Three Americans were
reported in the hotel at the time and one,
 National Broadcasting Corp. assistant
producer Robert Castenbach, was taken
hostage but was unharmed, the U.S.
Embassy said.

According to an account pieced together
from witnesses and security officers, the
 four-member team pulled up to the hotel at
about 5 a.m. Sunday in a dark blue car
with Lebanese license plates. They asked
for a room, were told none was available,
left and returned with submachine guns
and grenades.

Security officers said the comandos
moved from floor to floor of the five-story
hotel rousing guests from their sleep and
taking them captive. Someone called
police and the hotel was immediately
surrounded, witnesses said.

Security forces cut off communications
to the hotel and the guerrillas, holding the
top floor, opened fire and hurled grenades
down on the Syrians.

Military police and plain-clothes in-
telligence agents returned the fire and
besieged the building for about four hours
until Syrian Premier Gen. Abdul Rahman
Khleifawi and Defense Minister Mustafa
Tlas, who were at the scene, ordered the
assault.

Some troops dashed into the lobby and
worked their way upstairs while others
clambered up fire-truck ladders and en-
tered through upper-floor windows, firing
automatic weapons and tear-gas
grenades. After a furious three-hour gun
battle, they subdued the terrorists.

for quality, not quantity
 ",,"“You find time for the things you
want to do. Doing the other stuff
shows character.”

That’s how Charles Neuberg, who
is in the middle of the busy tax
season, rationalizes the additional
demands on his time as the incoming
president of the Arcadia Chamber of
Commerce.

Each new chamber president es-
tablishes his own priorities. With the
outgoing president, Tom Simmers, it
was increasing chamber
membership.

_Neuberg believes membership,
which now hovers around 950, has
pretty well stabilized. There’s
always some turnover, but he sées no
major growth now that Fashion Park
is completed.

What he is looking at is quality of
participation because ‘‘participation
is what makes it all work.”’ For in-
stance, he wants to enlarge the
Public Relations Committee from a
dozen members to 25 or 30.

Members of this committee
provide follow-up to the Am-
bassadors who bring new members
into the chamber. They act as a
sounding board to members who
may not be particularly active,
listening to complaints, helping to
solve little problems before they
become big.

Neuberg says he hears complaints
from chamber members in other
communities that they pay their dues
but derive no benefits. He doesn’t
 want that to happen in Arcadia.
The major benefit of chamber
membership, he says, is the
availability of group effort to im-
prove situations or correct
problems. ‘‘Each member is impor-
tant but we can be more effective
working together. If we can do this’
 we will have accomplished a lot.”

Neuberg and his wife Audrey have
been residents of Arcadia since 1957
although he didn’t open his business
and tax consulting firm here until
1963.

He’s gone through the chairs on the
chamber board, serving as an Am-
bassador and then on the Legislative
Committee, of which he is currently
chairman, as well as being
president-elect.

Although this is income tax time,
he helps people with tax planning
during the other months and with
growth problems. He helps them set
up books but any bookkeeping that
needs to be done he leaves to his
wife, who works closely with him.

Born in Brooklyn, he attended
school there. During World War II he
served with the U.S. Army in the
Pacific, returning after the war to
Long Island.

There he worked with Benjamin
Moore & Co., paint manufacturers,
coming to California as controller of
the firm’s plant here.

The Neubergs have a married
daughtger, Leslie White, who lives in
Hermosa Beach, and a grand-
daughter, Brooke, 7.

When he can find the time he en-
joys golf, photography and dancing.
He’s a member of the Arcadia
Kiwanis Club, the Presbyterian
Church, Arcadia Tournament of
Roses Association and the Arcadia
Beautiful Commission.

Occupation
Of Beirut
Completed
 ",,"BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) — Syrian
troops and tanks of the Arab League
peacekeeping army rolled into Beirut
today to complete the occupation of the
Lebanese capital and try to end the 19
months of Christian-Moslem civil war.

Spokesmen for the warring Lebanese
and Palestinian factions said the invasion
was a 99 per cent success by midmorning.
But sporadic firing continued between
radical Palestinians and right-wing
Christian militiamen in the rubble-strewn
heart of the city.

The Syrians controled the city’s radio
and television stations, the central bank
and government offices, and the 300-yard-
wide buffer dividing the city for three
miles.

Heavy machine-gun fire and artillery
and rocket explosions that began during
the night still shook Beirut as the 6,000
Syrian troops and 400 tanks, many
decorated with roses and olive branches,
moved into the city from the north, east
and south at dawn. The fighting later
subsided.

Jubilant residents rushed to balconies
and lined the steets to greet the Syrians
with chants of “‘ahlan wasahlan’’ — Arabic
for welcome. Housewives tossed rice on
the camouflaged tanks and sprayed crews
with rose water as they rumbled into an
area of fashionable cafes. One man
climbed onto a Syrian jeep and kissed two
young soldiers.

It was the first time that Beirut had been
occupied since 1958 when U.S. Marines
landed to put down a Moslem uprising
against Christian President Camille
Chamoun.

The first Syrian casualties since the
occupation began five days ago also were
reported. An infantryman's legs were
blown off by a land mine in Ein Rum-
maneh, a Christian slum area. Another
soldier was killed when an armor-piercing
grenade mounted on his rifle went off
 accidentally, and the blast wounded two
soldiers.

Syrian forces were also moving into
other areas of western Lebanon. There
was no word, however, of Syrian
penetration into Moslem-held Tripoli and
Sidon, 60 miles north and 25 miles south of
Beirut. The Syrians also were staying
away from the southern border, ap-
parently to avoid friction with Israel.

Bulldozers smashed through concrete
and sandbag barricades in the streets
while tank columns created a five-mile
security belt along the city’s crescent-
shaped Mediterranean seafront.

Syrians took control of government
office buildings, the water and electric
plants and the deserted barracks of the
Lebanese army.

The occupation was authorized at Arab
summit meetings last month in Cairo and
Riyadh where leaders called for a pan-
Arab force of 30,000 to end the war.

Bill Becomes Law

By 68 To 25 Vote;
President's Appeal
To Suctain Unheedec
 ",,"To Sustain Unheeded

WASHINGTON — () — The
senate voted ihe Taft-Harvley lab-
or bill into law today by overrid-
-_ President Truman's veto 68 to

This was six votes more than
the two-thirds margi . required to
enact the hotly-contested curbs on
labor unions.

The action was taken ite an
lith hour appeal from Mr. Truman
to sennte Democrats to uphold his
June 20 veto and Lill the measure
as “dangerous legislation.”

Mr. Truman wrote Senator
Barkley (D-Ky) just before the
senate vote that he is convinced
the bill will “do serious harm”

‘to the country.

| But Senators Sparkman (D-Ala)
and Lucas (D-Ill) were the only
senators who voted May 13 when
the senate passed the bill who
changed their stand today. Both
voted to sustain the president's
veto. They previously had voted
for passage of the measure.

State Senators Override

- Senators Tobey (R-NH) and
Overton (D-La), who were absent
when the senate first passed the
bill, voted to override the veto.
Twenty-two of the Democratic
members voted to sustain the
president: 20 to override his veto.
In addition, two absent Demo-
cratic members were announced
as against overriding the veto.
The split among Republicans
was 48 for, three against over-
riding the veto.
- Senators Wiley and McCarthy
of Wisconsin both voted to over-
ride the veto.
- Immediately after the senate
vote, CIO President Philip Mur-
ray said:
| “The situation which now con-
labor

Hartley will be by
the executive board of the CIO at
a@ meeting scheduled for Friday,
June 27 in Washington.”

“Tragic Mistake”

AFL President William Green
said the law will “force wide-
spread warfare” on the American
industrial front. He announced an
immediate campaign for its re-
peal. Green added:

“Congress has made a tragic
mistake.”

The new law provides for gov-
ernment injunctions to halt na-
tional emergency strikes for at
least 80 days. It also bans the
closed shop and amends the Wag-
ner act to restrict some other union
activities.

The result was a major victory
for the Republican-controlled con-
gress over Mr. Truman. Last week
the house sustained by a two-vote
margin the presiden’’s veto of the
$4,000,000,000 Republican tax-cut
bill.

Many Oppose Truman

The house overrode the labor
bill veto last Friday, by 331 to
83. a four to one margin. Thus
more than two-thirds of the mem-
bers of congress, including many
of his own party, went against
Mr. Truman's wishes.

Labor leaders bitterly assailed
the measure. Calling it a “slave
bill.” they and their followers
flooded lawmakers with thousands
of messages urging them to sus-
tain the president's veto.

A coalition of Democrats and a
few Republicans fought the bill
to the last. They had delayed the
vote until today with filibustering
tactics during a 30-hour continu-
ous session that ended Saturday
night.

Before crowded galleries sup-
porters of the bill and backers of
the veto fought the ballot all over
again in a three-hour period before
the showdown came.

Must Enforce Law

The senate action places on
President Truman and his admuin-
istration the enforcement of a
law that he defined flatly im his
veto message as “unworkable” and
“a clear threat to the successfu!
working of our democratic so-
ciety.”

Senator Taft (R-Ohio), one of
the authors of the measure, ¢x-
pressed confidence, however, that
Mr. Truman will do his best to
administer it.

The Ohio senator, who played
a leading part in drafting the
measure, said he regards the role
of the new five-member national
labor relations board and its coun-
sel of primary importance in suc-
———. administration of the pro-

aw.

“The president ought to appoint
outstanding citizens as members
of the board and to fill the coun-
sel post, because the latter is espe-
cially important,” Taft said.

He added that he assumes, with-
out knowing anything of the presi-
dent’s intentions, that the three
present members of the board wii)
hold over. They are Paul M. Her-
zog. chairman, John M. Houston,
and James J. Reynolds. Jr.

Taft said he has no
names in mind for the other twe
places or the counsel spot

Here are the major provisions
of the vetoed Taft-Hartley labor
bill which comes up for its final
test in the senate today:

Canterbury is a north-south street

tonight, we want them there on a

Wednesday afternoon.

Parents and residents from houses
on the street gathered in the street
beginning at 6:30 p.m. and set up signs
saying, “SLOW 25m.p.h. Speed Zone.’

Mrs. Street told The Examiner today
that the demonstretion got a response
from the Independence Police
Department.

“A motorcycle policeman came and
stayed for quite a while,’’ she said.
“And then one of those police station
wagons from Traffic Control came by,

wouldn’t be the last time they would
patrol there.

registration titles for luxury au-

It was two years and 43 reg-

stolen, police said.

Tallahassee police Sgt. Mayo

charging 18 counts of auto theft
was issued Friday against
Goldbaum, who wears a un-

 Davis said the Department of
Motor Vehicles issued the titles
to Goldbaum, 25, in the name
of Rolls Royce Motor Transport
Ltd.

“They issued the titles
thinking he was a prince,”
Davis said.

Many of the autos, including
Rolls-Royces, Jaguars, MGs
and a Maserati, were stolen in
 New York City and have turned
up in Miami and as far away
as Indiana and Virginia, Davis
said.

“They were bought by in-
nocent purchasers,”’ he said.

A police spokesman said
Goldbaum registered the autos
with forged certificates of title.

The spokesman said _ the
search for Goldbaum, who was
 last seen in Miami in Septem-
ber, was centered out of state.

“The FBI thinks they know
where he is but we don’t want
to scare him off,’ the spokes-
man said.

Police said they knew little
about Goldbaum’s movements,
but did learn how he first start-

 ",,"ALiier weeks and montns of
squabbling and infighting at the
state capitol, the selection of
sites and final authorization for
the construction of two new pris-
ons in Oklahoma has been ac-
complished. But it wasn’t ad-
vanced to this stage without
some compromises being made
by Gov. David Boren and the
State Department of Corrections.
Regrettably, the final decision
on where the prisons would be
located was made under threat
by two legislators to block pris-
on construction through in-
iliative petition and legal techni-
calities. Rep. Glenn Floyd, D-
Norman, and Sen. John Young,
. D-Sapulpa, have been harassing
the prison construction program
for several weeks for reasons
that are not altogether clear.
One of the arguments against
building two prisons has been
that the next legislature would
have to appropriate additional
funds to complete the project.
Even if this is true. as it ap-
pears, blocking the construction
of two badlv-needed prison facil-
ities borders on political irres-
ponsibility.

Under the compromise, Gov.
Boren agreed to build the pro-
posed Union City prison on
state-owned land at Lexington,
10 miles south of Norman, and
to proceed with the second pris-
on at Hominy, about 30 miles
northwest of Tulsa, on land to be
donated to the state. The deci-
sion to build the prisens on
state-owned land or land to be
 donated Was made in order to
thwart a threatened lawsuit to
delay any land-buying for at
least 90 days, giving opponents
time to circulate a petition to
force the issue on the ballot.

The delay would be almost
unacceptable in view of the
serious overcrowding at
McAlester penitentiary, and in
other state corrections facilities.
Work already is under way on a
400-inmate diagnostic and recep-
tion center and medium security
prison at Lexington and the fed-
eral Law Enforcement Assis-
tance Administration has as-
sured the governor the location
of a second prison nearby, al-
though not entirely desirable,
would not disqualify the state
for some $3.6 million in LEAA
funds.

Spending several millions of
dollars for additional facilities to
incarcerate criminals is not a
happy task for the legislature or
the governor. But something
must be done to cope with the
rising crime rate. Leniency on
the part of district attorneys,
judges and jurors and the poor
supervision of convicts on parole
have contributed greatly to con-
clusion on the part of some per-
sons that crime does pay. Lax-
ness toward criminals also con-
tributes to the high recidivism
rate among lawbreakers. Hope-
fully, clearing the roadblocks for
two additional modern prison fa-
cilities will serve the best inter-
ests of Oklahoma in future
vears.

What May Be in the Rusaisn Mind
Diplomats and military men have
supposed that the Changkufeng
fighting would be kept localized, on
the theory that Japan wante no war
because of her Chiinese involvement
and that Russia has too much to
worry about in Europe. This 65 mere
deduction. Aside from general back~
ground, all the state, war and navy
departments know is what they read
in the newspspers—meaning the of-
ficial versions from Tokio and Moe-

cow,

Several bizarre theories as to the
“real reason” behind the outbreak
have gained wide credence in Washs
ington. But the best Far Eastern ex-
perts are unwilling to go beyond sug-
gesting as possiblities:

1. That Russia has sought to dif-
fuse Japanese military energy and
take heat off the Chinese. Chinese
resistance might suddenly collapse—
28 Ethiopian resistance to Ytallan
troops did—and Russia may have
been warned of such # likelihood,

2 That Russia desired to teat Ja~
panese reaction and find out how
weak or strong Japanese resistance
would be,

3 That Russia, believing the point
of maximum Japanese weakness may ;
iave been reached, prefers to strike!
afore Japan can consolidate beri?

At any rate, Russian troops moved

 ",,"Borrowing largely from peace marshal
training guides, our proposals are spelled out
below. The various marshal roles and tactics
focus on eliminating panic, keeping your cool
and instigating others to keep theirs to
prevent violence.

Effective peace marshals keep their
statements as calm, clear and concise as
possible. They come up with quick decisions
and have a sense of timing enabling them to
grasp the moment and act.

The degree of emotional arousal in a group
correlates with the degree of reasoning that
can be effective. When in a group on the brink
of violence, the peace marshal should meet
the groups ability to reason with short,
simple, effective statements that make
sense. If they can’t be dissuaded from
violence, try to divert them to a target of
lesser importance.

Less volatile situations can be further
relaxed with more elaborate reasoning and
group expression of feelings and ideas. This
serves the purpose of lessening arousal and
confusion, aids in the purpose of learning and
leads to decisions of more acceptable actions.

Peach marshals often have the dual func-
tion of participating in a protest while they
keep an ear to the ground for runaway

Anyone that would over-react to such an
assembly with authoritarian disapproval is
not for peace, but is a force to be dealt with by
the peace marshals in an effort to contain
violence. A violent reaction to potential or
existing violence is counterproductive; it
only leads to an escalation of the violent

AUTOMOBILE CRASH
 ",,"Byron G. Whetzel, 20, son of Mr.
and Mrs. Ralph W. Whetzel, of near
Lafayette, formerly of the Cutler vi-
cinity and who would have been @
Senior in the School of Engineering
at Purdue the coming term, instantly
lost his life in a crossroads automo-
bile crash southeast of Lafayette
shortly after 5 o’clock last Sunday
evening. Funeral services were held
at the Cutler Presbyterian church
‘Tuesday afternoon at 2:30 o’clock and
burial was made in Ball Hill ceme-
tery.

The crash that took the life of the
young man occurred about a mile
from the Whetzel home. He had
started for Dayton, Ind., to attend a
young people’s meeting to be held at
the Presbyterian church. -He was rid-
ing alone when he crashed into an-
other machine, occupied by Mr. and
Mrs. Robert Hopkins, and Mr. and
Mrs. Frank Meekins, of Lafayette,
who were returning to their home
from swimming near Dayton. Mrs.
Hopkins, a bride since Jane 11th, was
seriously injured in the mixup and
was taken to the Home hospital at
Lafayette, by Paul Metzger, who lives
not far from the scene, and among
the first to reach the unfortunate
lady. After an examination by phy-
sicians it was said at the hospital
that Mrs. Hopkins was badly shaken
up and had suffered from shock. She
also received a very crushing blow
across the abdomen. The Hopkins
Ford coach was almost completely
wrecked and the Whetzel Chevrolet
car was badly damaged. An ambu-
lance was called from Lafayette and
took the young man’s body to the
Home hospital and then to the funer-
al home and the parents were noti-
fied. When word was feceived here
and at Cutler, former homes of the
Whetzels, it occasioned much - sad-
ness. The unfortunate youth was
born in Carroll county, near Cutler,
on June 28, 1913. He attended the
Cutler school, where he was graduat-
ed with the class of 1930. He moved
with his parents to Tippecanoe coun-
ty a little over a year ago. Survivors
besides the parents are a sister, Hel-
en, also a student at Purdue and a
grandmother, Mrs. Jennie Loman, of
Cutler. He was a member of the Cut-
ler Presbyterian church and of the
Christian Endeavor Society of the
Dayton Presbyterian church. He was
regarded as an exemplary young man
and was a straight “A” student at

 ","By ED KOHN

Nows Analvsis
 ","An intense legal debate that could have repercussions
across the country for years to come is underway in
Washington, D.C. in the wake of the Mayday antiwar
demonstrations there earlier this month.

The principal question is this: Did the government
deliberately break the law in order to preserve order in the
Nation’s Capitol during those demonstrations?

The Mayday demonstrators’ plan, first announced in
August, 1970, was to block early morning commuter traffic
into the city Monday, May 3, and thereby strangle the
* government’s operation.

The D.C. police department, known as the Metropolitan
Police, aided by thousands of soldiers and acting in close
concert with high-ranking officials of the Nixon
administration, reacted to the Mayday plan by arresting
7,000 persons on one day, the largest such arrest in the
nation’s history.

During the rest of the week, the Metropolitan Police
arrested another 5,000 demonstrators, literally flooding and
re-flooding the city’s jails.

Civil Liberties Ignored

But the government, in its haste to keep the streets clear
of the “mobs,” ignored the demonstrators’ civil liberties to
an apparently unprecedented extent.

Atty. Gen. John N. Mitchell, who, like Vice President
Sprio T. Agnew frequently speaks for the President, called
the police department’s reaction to the demonstrations a
“decisive opposition to mob force.” Mitchell added that he
hoped the Metropolitan Police Department’s actions ‘‘will set
an example for other communities, in similar circumstances,
to do the same.”

The antiwar demonstrators, along with those arrested
downtown for no apparent reason, strongly disagree.

The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which is
now backing tests of the arrests in the courts, believes that
the government controlled the “‘mob” by “suspending the
rights guaranteed to us all under the Constitution.”

Investigations Urged

One former Assistant U.S. Attorney, Robert L. Ackerly,
now a Washington lawyer, is receiving support for a proposal
that government officials be held responsible for their orders
in both civil damage suits and in criminal charges. He is
urging the convening of a special grand jury, led by a
prosecutor not connected with the Justice Department, to
investigate the government’s actions.

And the Chief Judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals, David
L. Bazelon, has named a special judicial panel to investigate
what happened during the demonstrations and to determine
what other alternatives were available to the police
department.

Among the topics under consideration are:

—Were the arrests of May 3-7 legal or in any other way
appropriate?

—Did the police act in a legitimate manner in suspending

_Standard procedures for arresting, charging and detaining
suspects?

—Was the traditional function of bail abused by police,
prosecutors or the courts?

 —VDid the government act properly in calling up Woops
and managing the crisis?

—Were techniques designed to handle just such situations
ignored?

Pre-Planned Detention

According to high-ranking Justice Department officials,
the Department had decided in advance that the streets were
to be kept open at all costs and that those arrested were to
be detained for at least 12 hours to “keep them off the
streets.”

Exactly how this was to have been done remains a
question, because no one person controlled all 7,000 May 3
arrests,

Most of the arrests, according to the Justice Department,
were justified. However, one Justice Department official said
on May 4 that “‘when you arrest 7,000 people, you’re bound
to get a few who shouldn’t be there.”’ Atty. Gen. Mitchell,
breakfasting with reporters two weeks ago, maintained that
“most of those arrested were people who had been ordered
to clear an area,” ,

Witnesses of the week’s events however, have repeatedly
reported seeing arrests of people simply walking down the
street. Other persons were arrested at sites of demonstrations
before they had an opportunity to commit illegal acts.

‘Free - Arrest Zone’

The ACLU, in a full-page advertisement in the Washington
Post last week, said that “the majority of those arrested were
not committing any offense whatever, and the government
knew it when they swept them up.” Terming the
government’s actions the ‘‘Vietnamization of America,’’ the
ACLU contended that a “free-arrest zone” — similar to a
free-fire zone in Indochina — was established in downtown
Washington.

“Anybody with a beard, long hair or unconventional dress
was marked for immediate arrest, no matter where they were
or what they were doing,” the ACLU charged.

“They were the ‘enemy’ just as all civilian Vietnamese —
North or South, men, women and children — are the enemy
— ‘gooks,’ ‘slants,’ and ‘slopes.’ ”

Justification

The strongest justification for mass arrests and other
strong responses to citizen protests is the doctrine of raison
d’etat (reason of state). This principle, according to a
definition by Harvard University political scientist Carl J.
Friedrich, states that “‘whatever is required to insure the
survival of the state must be done by the individuals
responsible for it, no matter how repugnant such an act may
be to them in their private capacity as decent and moral
men.”

However, no responsible official has said that the survival
of the nation — or even that of Washington — was at stake
during the Mayday protests. But Asst. Atty. Gen. William H.
Rehnquist, in a speech in North Carolina on May 5, suggested
that Washington was almost in a state of “qualified martial
law.”

Qualified or not, martial law historically has permitted
numerous actions by government officials that would
normally be considered excessive or illegal.

 ‘The courts have ruled that the President is the only person
qualified to declare a state of martial law. If President Nixon
had chosen to declare martial law, he could have done so
without the approval of Congress, because a state of
emergency, declared in 1950 by President Harry S. Truman,
has never been rescinded.

But the President never declared martial law. He turned
over management of governmental response to a small group
of key advisers, led by Mitchell.

The Fourth, Sixth and Eighth Amendment; — which are
negated by the imposition of martial law — restrict the
government in its actions against citizens whom it presumes
to have committed crimes; they require probable cause for
arrest, that the suspect know of the charges against him, and
that he be given the rights of a reasonable bail and of a
speedy trial.

But, at least on Mayday, things just didn’t work out that
way.

New Arrest Forms

After the 1968 riots in Washington that followed the
assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, the District
developed a new field arrest form that included specific
details of the arrest and a photograph of the arrestee.

However, Metropolitan Police Chief Jerry V. Wilson
suspended the use of the form early on the morning of May
3. He later reversed his decision.

Terming the situation “potentially riotious,”’ a police
department lawyer said that policemen had no time to fill
out the forms because they were constantly under attack
from the demonstrators. Lawyers handling the protestors’
cases have contended, however, that the police had plenty of
time to fill out the simple forms. Reporters at the scenes of
arrests noted that some of those arrested waited with the
arresting officers for 45 minutes before being taken to
holding compounds.

The overall result of this practice was that the police and
prosecutors had thousands of persons in custody without any
idea of where, when or by whom they were arrested, the
specifics of their arrest or — in many cases — the names of
those arrested.

As the city courts become aware of these arrest practices,
they began dismissing charges in large numbers — some
before the accused appeared in court. In one week, they thus
disposed of nearly 6,000 cases.

The ACLU has directed attention to the “falsification of
records” after the arrests were made. Under the direct
supervision of an assistant attorney general, government
lawyers went through the Washington Coliseum, where
several thousand prisoners had been transferred for the night,
belatedly completing field arrest forms and inserting the
name of one of seven police officers — who were not
designated ‘‘arresting officers” as the field form requires, but
“court officers” for purposes of prosecution.

No Government Prosecution

The ACLU has charged that the “court officers’ still
would not know with what each person specifically was
charged. And it also contends that the government had no
intention of getting convictions on its charges of disorderly
conduct, jaywalking or unlawful entry. What apparently
 basis. For further info, call x3045.

MASS PROTEST, MASS ARREST, AND THE
LAW-—Threatened with civil disobedience in the wake of
three weeks of mass anti-war protests, such as the above,
government officials cracked down. Over a four-day period
authorities made a record number of arrests. The question
now is — were constitutional rights and liberties for the
individual lost in the shuffle?

happened, according to the ACLU, was that arrest
procedures ‘that would result in solid court cases’? were
abandoned in favor practices that would simply keep people
off the streets.

The bail situation was similarly confused, as judges
alternately raised and lowered — depending on what Police
Chief Wilson requested — the amount required for release on
charges of disorderly conduct. Also, the judges determined
that the prisoners denied bail were being held under
conditions equivalent to “cruel and unusual punishment.”

The police and Justice Departments have already
suggested that if they had confronted the demonstrators with
larger amounts of force — rather than arrest them —
additional violence and bloodshed would have been
inevitable.

But the ACLU and other non-law-enforcement groups
insist that the emergency would have been better resolved if
it had been permitted to evolve even further — with the
consequence that governmental operations would have been
slowed by about one hour — the same amount of time lost in
a moderate snow storm.

More Incentive for Police Vital
 ",,"SYRACUSE IS sensing a member of
ite police force to the New York State
Police School at Troy.

Two years ago, it sent another mem-
ber to the Traffic School at Northwestern
University, Evanston, U2.

Both schools are recognized as the best
in the country in their special fields.

Things are looking up. Maybe the
etty hall will realize yet that incentive
and merit count heavily in police work.

It has been more than 30 years since
a member of the Syracuse department
was sent to the Troy school. The gap
between students at the traffic school
was almost as great.

If incentive and merit counted as
much as they should in police work, some
alert young cop would be sent to one or
the other of these schools, or to others,
every year or s0.

It would be a reward for good work,
but at the same time would assure the
highest quality of police performance in
the city.

In addition, there would be less ques-
farce: promotions would be made as a
result of individual efficiency.

*

THE RISE IN crime in the last few
years indicates clearly that cities cannot
get along from now on without the high-
est training possible of its law enforce-
ment personnel.

The need is for men with a high de-
gree of training backed up by the type of
thinking that is always a step ahead of
the lawbreaker’s.

Syracuse has provided training
 little fault can be found. It is based on
tested and proved fundamentals.

But this school can be improved and
the decision to send a man to the Troy
school is a sign of it. Capt. Paul Mc-
Laughiin has been selected for the honor.
He is a member of the faculty of the
school here.

An established policy of sending
men away to school periodically, either
to Troy, Evanston, the FBI school in
Washington or elsewhere, would pay
excellent dividends.

It would be an incentive to good
work.

It would improve the local force
substantially and steadily.

li would keep the force up-to-date
on the latest developments in criminol-
ogy.

Chief of Police Kelly deserves high
commendation for his policy.

*

ANOTHER ESSENTIAL to a good po-
lice force, of course, is a well-planned,
efficient headquarters building.

The need ‘of a new one in Syracuse
cannot be emphasized too much. For-
tunately, it is high on the list of capi-
tal improvements worked out by Mayor
Henninger and his aides.

It can’t be started too soon. Svra-
cuse police have put up with the dismal
old barn they now occupy for far too
many years.

Syracuse has a good police force. But
like everything else it can be improved
and a new headquarters building, a svs-
tem of advancement hased on merit and
incentive and taking advantage regularly
of schooling opportunities will do it.

Syracuse could well make them the
city’s first needs in 1959.

 ",,"*The first local-group talk on the judicial amend-
ment to the state constitution was to be made yes-
terday before the Harvard Rotary club by State
Senator Robert McClory

Every voter got a copy-of this proposed amend-
ment through the mail several days ago from Coun-
ty Clerk R D Woods It was a “bulk mail"" envel-
ope and it contained the official explanation from
State Secretary Carpentier on all four ""of the special
state propositions that will come before the voters
on Tuesday. Nov 4 If you missed it. go back and
look at your mail If you looked it over and didn't
get much out of it. here are some things to be re-
membered about the judicial amendment

_ It would take the J.P.'s off the fee system of
operating their courts “and make fhem salaried
employees of the state, taking. their orders di-,
rectly frém an “associate judge” (presently the
county judge) and indirectly from the circuit
judge. ‘
There are good points to this arrangement, and
possibly bad ones We the people have to decide,
through discussion and argument whether the good
outweigh the bad The amendment, it seems to us
frankly would make Circuit Judge Willlam Carroll
a morepowerful~and influential figure than -he_is
today It would make him the “boss of justice in
all McHenry. County. Here is. why. -_
As we understand it. the present county judge
would work under him as associate judge Judge
Carroll, would have the power of-naming additiona
associate judges, if the legal work in this counts
warranted tt The so-called county judge could no!
hold any other political office and this we like We
never could, see the sense to dual office-holding
where you find the chairman of the county board
for example, also being a member of the board o:
review Or where you find the mayor being lique
control commissioner Or where you find # schoo!
board member also driving a school bus So the
judicial amendment would forbid anyone from as:
sociate judge on up from holding other political
or government office
Actually, what the amendment is SUPPOSEE
to. do is make justice more speedy, more business:
Judge Carroll is taking a winter vacation. Fine
—he needs it. So Judge Cowlin—or whomever is
Associate Judge—handles the work, civil or crim-
inal. Now the small thought arises: Who tells
Judge Carroll when he has to get back to work,
under the new plan? Answer: It is the Supreme
Court of the State of Hlinois, Judge Carroll
takes his orders from theny—under the amend-
ment.

If we are wrong in these general statemepts, we

   
 
    
  
   

terms the people understand We iave to use names
so they will know what we apé tulking about
Surely it should be toa best interest of law-
yers—local and county--fo have the people under

in this case is just’as important as the vote of a

ground for his claims that in providing for
the welfare of workers, “the record clearly
proves that a vast majority of those in the

AT UL VA. DANCES
 Change Being Made Because
of “Misapplication of Prin-
‘ciples of Honor”
 ",,"University, Va., April 9. (4P)—A
statement made public today by the
University of Virginia dance  so-
cleties said that as an experimental
measure students will be released
during the Easter week dance from
the honor system pledge forbidding
them to attend a university dance if
they have had a drink since noon of
the day of the dance.

The statement, issued by the P-K
and German societies, was said to
have the approval of the student
senate and the honor committee.

The change is being made, the
statement said, because the pledge
“is considered a mis-application of
the principles of honor: and the
necessity for such a pledge is a re~
flection upon our conceptions of
gentlemanly conduct.”

“The principle behind the plan.”
the statement continued, “is not to
originate a system governed by a
‘bouncing’ committee. The ultimate
end hoped for is that the dances
will take care of themselves with-
out necessity for set rules and re-
gulations.”

At the same time, the following
control system was announced:

An executive committee of twelve
members of the dance societies will
be in charge.

Each student attending the dance
will be asked to report to a mem-
ber of this committee when he ob-
serves ‘any person. whether stu-
dent. alumnus, guest or member of
the faculty, whom he consideres in
any degree under the influence of
liquor.” If the committee member
shall decided that the person ob-
served “is in any degree intoxicat-
ed,” he shal ask the offender to
leave the dance.

These offenders. if members of
the dance societies, shall be drop-
ped from membership. If not. they
shall be denied hope of membership.
Also, they shall be asked not to re-
turn to any university dance for a
year, and if this request is violat-
ed, the committee . wil] recommend
to the dean of men that the violator

President Charles de Gaulle
basked today in the welcoming
warmth of Paraguay, which
greeted him with vivas and rose
petals after a Peronist riot

president, on the eighth leg of
his 10-nation Latin-American

of Paraguay’s 450-year-old capi-

come demonstration. As he rode
through the streets in an open
car they waved flags, shouted
greetings and pelted him with
red rose petals.

The scene contrasted sharply
with the rock, tear-gas and gun
battle that erupted a few hours
earlier in the industrial city of
Cordoba, a Peronist stronghold
in central Argentina.
 | At least 16 persons were
‘wounded as armed police
charged a Peronist mob that
closed in on a car carrying De
Gaulle and Argentine President
Arturo Illia.

De Gaulle’s short tour of Cor-

his speech to some 2,000 dele
gates and guests last Frida;
was applauded a number o}
times.

‘There was no booing. There
was no jeering,’”? Meany said.

He conceded that a number

 on said his wage-price control
program was working.

stitutional right to laugh,’’ said
the 77-year-old labor chief to
warm. applause and a standing
ovation when he finished by
saying ‘'This is still a democra-
cy. This is still not a
monarchy.

Meany said Nixon himself de-

parted from the minutely de-
tailed schedule the White House
itself had laid down.

He said contrary to reports
that there was no escort com-
mittee for Nixon when he fin-
ished his speech, that there was
such a committee but Nixon lit-
erally bolted from the platform,
his security men pulled back a
rope barrier and Nixon plunged
into the crowd to shake hands,

Meany said he asked dele-
gates and guests to be seated
when large numbers of dele-
gates started to converge to-
ward Nixon.

“*¥ committed the cardinal sin
of saying ‘Let’s go on with the
second act.’ Well, that was my
reaction,’? Meany said to loud
convention applause,

“The President did not come
here to make a speech, He
came here to contrive the situ-
ation,’’ Meany added.

The White House said after
 Friday’s incidents that Nixon
had been treated with ‘‘studied
contempt’? by the labor con-
vention,

Meany said Nixon’s speech
was purely political and did not
touch on the one major issue of
concern to organized labor—
whether new federal wage con-
trols prevent labor contracts
from taking effect,

Meany said labor will contin-
ue to fight against rulings of
Nixon’s Pay Board, on which
five labor leaders serve, if they
disagree,

He said Nixon’s throwing
away his prepared speech and
saying he would speak
“straight from the shoulder,”

- was a “corny act.”’

“We respect the office and
we respect the man who holds
the office,’?’ Meany said of the
presidency,

“This doesn’t mean we've got
to be subservient to the man
that holds the office,’ or to
submit to anything labor con-
siders unjust, Meany said.

A close aide of Meany said
earlier that Meany had set a
deliberate course designed to
force Nixon to kick him off the
Pay Board or junk federal
wage controls altogether.

other Egyptian troops on the

of State Henry A. Kissinger.
Their talks followed similar
meetings Friday among Kissin-
ger, Syrian Deputy Foreign
Minister Mohammed Zakaria
Ismail and Egyptian Foreign
Minister Ismail Fahmy.

The Soviet first deputy for-
eign minister, Vassili Kuznet-
sov, flew into Damascus. He
was followed into the Syrian
capital 15 minutes later by
President Houari Boumedienne
of Algeria, who conferred ear
lier in Cairo with President An.

have been resupplied with food

 ","By JEFF EVANS
Herald Staff Writer
 ","Three area teen-agers were injured,
two believed seriously, Thursday night
when the auto in which they were
riding exploded on Anderson’s south
side, at 1810 W. 53rd St., across from
the South Drive-In.

Special investigators from several
law enforcement agencies throughout
central Indiana converged upon the
scene in an attempt to piece together
the details of an apparent ‘foul play”
Situation.

TWO TEEN-AGERS WERE found
Stumbling in a dazed state by
witnesses, while the third, who suffered
only superficial burns, fled the area on
foot.

A massive search by city police, local
firefighters and several concerned
citizens across an approximate
three-mile area proved futile. The
subject was located some three and
one-half hours later at a private
residence several miles from the scene.

Authorities from the Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms Division, the
Indiana State Police post at Pendleton,
the Explosives Ordnance Disposal
Team from Fort Benjamin Harrison,
known as the “Bomb Squad,” and local
investigators pored over the charred
remains of a 1962 Chevrolet Impala.

WITNESSES WITHIN 30 yards of the
incident told The Herald they heard
four distinct and separate explosions.

Although police officials were
uncertain late Thursday who was
driving the automobile, 17-year-old
David Tildon Hall, 1732 W. 38th St., was
the most seriously injured. He
reportedly suffered third-degree burns
over 85 to # percent of his body. He
was taken to St. John’s Hospital before
being transferred to the burn unit at
Wishard Memorial Hospital in
Indianapolis. He is reported in critical
condition in the intensive care unit
there

Flint L. Bryant, 17, Rt. 2, Pendleton,
sustained third-degree burns over some
S percent of his body. He has been
admitted to St. John's Hospital, listed
late Thursday in fair to serious
condition
THE THIRD SUBJECT, 16-year-old
Tony Tompkins, 4409 Del Mar Court,
was later found by city police at a
 residence in the 600-block of North
Parkway Drive. He was taken to St.
John’s Hospital also, where doctors
reported his condition was not believed
to be serious. Hospital spokesmen
indicated Tompkins suffered only
superficial burns to the upper part of
his body.

Both Hall and Bryant told police they
did not know Tompkins, a hitchhiker
they had picked up a short time before
the explosion.

Police heads had requested Fort
Benjamin Harrison helicopters be sent
to the area to aid in the search for the
third subject.

Sources told The Herald late
Thursday no apparent propellants were
found in the car. It is believed “‘bomb
squad’’ investigators are searching for
any indication of dynamite explosives.
At press time Thursday, chief
investigators said they believed the
incident was not accidental.

A LARGE HOLE was found gaping in
the front floorboard area of the
automobile. The interior of the vehicle
was gutted by the subsequent blaze and
witnesses reported all three occupants
were on fire as they fled the auto.

George Davis, 1810 W. 53rd St., owner
of the Edgewood Mobile Home Park,
where the auto finally came to a stop,
was Outside his residence when the
explosions occurred.

“I heard four distinct blows and saw
a ball of fire out there. I then found one
fellow laying in a ditch, and all | could
do was yank his clothes off,’ Davis
Said

“THE SKIN WAS just hanging on
them like it would come off in
peelings. Both fellows appeared to be in
shock. One of the boys just kept asking
for a drink of water,’ he added.

One of the first officers on the scene
told The Herald both youths were
wearing blue jeans and no shirts. He
indicated both were ‘charred’ from
the waist up

The vehicle and several packages of
evidence obtained at the scene have
been taken to the APL crime lab for
further analysis

ALTHOUGH FOUL PLAY is strongly
suspected, authorities report they have
no leads as to motive or persons who
may be involved

Radicals, Police Clash At Comp Center
 ",,"Two students were shot, at least
three persons were briefly hospitalized
with injuries and eight persons arrested
last night as 200 radicals clashed with
police and Free Campus Movement
members near the Undergraduate
Library.

Karlier in the day, students and
police clashed near Pine iicll, the
University’s computation center,
following a three-hour takeover of that
$5 million facility. Four persons were
arrested following that incident.

John Dawson, 16, a Gunn High
School student and son of Assoc.
History Prof. J. Phillip Dawson, was
shot in the right thigh, possibly by a
45 calibre automatic pistol as he stood
with a group of six FCM members ina
parking lot adjacent to Owens House
on Salvatierra St.

All police agencies on campus last
night use .38 special calibre.

Dawson was being treated in the
emergency room at Stanford Hospital.
According to a hospital spokesman, he
was in “fair condition” early this
morning. Witnesses at the shooting
reported that at least six shots were
fired in the direction of the group.

Second Student Shot

Police later issued an all points
bulletin for a 25-year old white male,
5’-10”, wearing a brown or tan coat
and driving a faded red Volkswagon
with California license plates.

The other student shot was
identified as Doug Lempereur, a senior
History major who lives at the DKE
house. He went to the hospital, where
the wound—a bullet graze in one
thigh—was diagnosed, but treatment
was not necessary. Lempereur was with
the FCM group near Owens House.

Prof. Dawson said last night that his
son is not a member of the FCM.
Lempereur’s political affiliation could
not be immediately determined.

FCM-Demonstrators Clash

Several bitter fights broke out
between photographers and
by-standers-some of whom were
apparently FCM members—and the
fired-up demonstrators. One FCM
member, Claude Long, was hospitalized
with feet, back and head injuries. Other
persons reported being struck with
rocks, bricks and heavy flag staffs. One
person reported being struck in the
mouth by a male holding a rock in his
fist.

Ed Jagels, an FCM member, said his
group planned to press charges and said
that he anticipated the arrest of at least
one University student.

Cowell Health Center reported early
this morning that six students had been
treated for varying injuries sustained
during the evening. One of the students
at Cowell was treated for club wounds.

New Police Tactics

The police last night’ used a tactic
never before séen on the Stanford
campus—following demonstrators into
dormitory rooms. During the course of
the evening, squads of police entered at
least two buildings, Stern-Larkin and
Crothers Memorial. At least one person
was arrested in Larkin.

Last night’s trouble errupted after a
meeting in the Old Union courtyard
that had been called to discuss ways of
implementing the student strike called
 GCeclaine tO NOM a Mareih LOUAY LrOith
the scheduled noon rally to either SKI
or the Industrial Park, the group voted
to declare a state of ‘peoples’ war” on
campus and began a march to the
dorms. Some 400 persons were in the
march with it left the Old Union.
Affinity Groups

The group left the courtyard, and
passing through White Plaza, became
embroiled in one of the first fights of
the evening with FCM members and
photographers. After a _ five-minute
delay, it moved past the back side of
the bookstore, breaking several
windows despite cries of “tno rocks”,
and down to the lower level of the
UGLY. Several police units moved into
position near the demonstrators, who
continued their march down Escondido
St., through Wilbur, and back to the
Wilbur lawn.

It paused there for a few moments
to permit formation of affinity groups
“to do what has to be done, on any
level it can be done” and moved out
onto Escondido St. again. About 200
people left the Wilbur lawn.

But the group was _ nearly
surrounded by the police forces as it
headed back towards the UGLY, and it
turned back into the intersection of
Escondido and Galvez Sts. Police in full
riot gear then moved up, occupying the
nearby parking lots, fields, walkways
and bushes. The situation was static for
a few moments, and then the police
began swarming down toward the
demonstrators, who at first responded
with hoots, jeers and rocks, but then
panicked and began to run. As some
demonstrators moved into the nearby
dorms, police followed them, arresting
several,

‘ Police Chase Demonstrators

Police then chased most of the
demonstrators out of the intersection,
declared the group to be an illegal
assembly, and threatened to arrest a
Daily reporter. Less than a minute
later, a Daily photographer was maced
and nearly run over by a squad car.

Dawson and Lempereur were shot
moments later about 1'2 blocks away.

The demonstrators then broke up
into small groups, roaming the campus.
Several false fire alarms were turned in,
and numerous firecrackers were set off
throughout the academic area. Some
trashing in the academic regions also
reportedly took place.

The North County Jail, where those
arrested last night were taken for
booking, reported a bomb threat, but
the building was not evacuated. The
bomb, the called told sheriffs, would go
off unless “‘all political prisoners are
freed.”

Quiet returned to the campus
shortly after 1:00 a.m., but the area
was under exceedingly heavy patrol by
 sheriffs on foot and in squad cars.
Tactical Squad members patrolled the
White Plaza-quad region.

Of the eight persons, six had been
booked as of early this morning: Leslie
K., Nassan, a non-student, for resisting
arrest and disturbing the peace; Ian
Frazier, a non-student, assault with a
deadly weapon; James Wrigley, a
non-student, disturbing the peace and
interfering; and Michel Holman, a
sophomore in General Studies,
interfering. Two other juveniles also
were booked early this morning.

Earlier in the day, 80 police and 150
demonstrators clashed near the
$5-million computation center, which
the protestors had occupied and shut
down for most of the afternoon.

Four Arrested

Four persons were arrested near the
building on charges of failure to
disperse and remaining at the site of a
riot without dispersing. Several persons
were injured as club-swinging police
charged the crowd after a
confrontation between Sheriffs
Sargeant Don Tamm and Associate
Professor H. Bruce Franklin.

Those arrested were Theresa
Ramirez and Sharon Winslow,
sophomores in General Studies; James
Little, an acting assistant professor in
Statistics; and Tony Gray, identified as
a “community worker” by suspended
English T.A. Janet Weiss. Little was
released on bail last night at 11:30, but
the three girls were still being held in
North County Jail in lieu of the $630
bail fee.

Damage to the computer, located in
Pine Hall, was estimated at $1,000.
Loss of revenue from “down time” —
the period when the computer is
inoperable — was estimated at $600 per
hour.

When the demonstrators cut the
power supply shortly before 1:30 p.m.,
the computer “crashed,” and
computation center officials estimated
that it could not be “brought up”’ again
before midnight. Most of the damage
was caused by ripped wires and the
handling of some memory tapes being
stored in the center.

The computation center was shut
down after about 300 persons left a
noon rally in White Plaza and marched.
chanting various anti-war slogans, to
the building.

When it arrived at Pine Hall, the
group found signs on all the doors
reading, “Sorry, Computer Center
Temporarily Closed.” After some
discussion, one of the gates in the rear
of the building was forced open, and
the crowd swarmed into the loading
zone area. Ladders were also brought to
the scene, and some demonstrators
gained access to the roof.

The South and Midwest, dotted
with silent oil refineries, faced
serious gasoline shortages today.
More than 21,500 oilworkers were
idle as the CIO pressed its de-
mands for a 30 per cent pay raise
and other concessions. Texas alone
had at least 15,500 workers off
the job and 10 plants had closed.

Gasoline famines threatened
such widely separated points as
Houston and Detroit. There was
tvo gasoline for the public at Port
Arthur and negotiations between
union and management to provide
it had reached a stalemate.

Toledo, with four refineries clos-
ed, was similarly hard hit. City
and union officials agreed on a
rationing plan for essential users
of motor fuel.

The Standard Oil and six other
refineries were closed at Cleve-
land and the city felt an acute
gasoline pinch. In Detroit, an es-
timated 65 per cent of service sta-

Russia Gives Lie
To Ruble’s Value
 ","By SYLVIA PORTER
 ","Today and during the next couple of months, Rus-
sia’s millions of citizens are turning in 10 of their pre-1961
rubles for one new one — and as they line up at bank
widows to make the exchange, they’re hearing the pleas-
ant propaganda that their new ruble is worth $1.11
agalnst $1 for our greenback, that their ruble now has a
greater gold content than the sinking U. S. dollar and

‘that the ruble has become “the most stable currency (in
 the world.”

These are infuriating dis-
tortions, downright Hes.

It is outrageous that we shoulc
be sitting by quietly while the
Soviets mock us with another
skillful money murder. And ever
if these within the Soviet orbit
don't hear the facts, surely it is
imperative that the free world
should realize that Russia is daring
/to publicize a slash of more than
55 per cent in the value of her
ruble in terms both. of gold and
of the U.S. dollar as an upgrad-
ing!

First, here’s a short background,
In mid-November the Soviet Goy-
ernment: announced another in 2
series of currency devalutions un-
der the Commurist regime, to take
effect in the first three months of
1961, The operation is taking place
now.

In this devaluation, the Rus-
sians have been ordered to turn
in 10 old rubles—each said to
have a hacking of 0.222168 gre gis
of fine gold—for one new ruble,
This new one is declared to
have a backing of 0.987412 grams
of fine gold.

Boast the Russians: since the
U. S. dollar has only 0.8886705
grams of fine gold behind it, clear-
ly the ruble is now worth more
than the U. S. dollar in terms of
zold. And since, they argue, they're
giving the new ruble a value of
$1.11, clearly it’s worth more than
the American greenback. And
since they're doing this while gold}
is flowing out of the U. 8, and:
he American dollar is under at+|
ack, clearly Russia is becoming |
supreme in the currency sphere

$82.59. And Mrs, Hope didn’t.
Her emotions were not equipped
to deal with net figures, “Isn't
it thrilling?” she gasped. “I
adore taking a flyer!”

On a third transaction, Elec-
tric Eel, she took a loss of
$189.71, by the side of Mr.
Evans’ gain of $81.04,

All told, while listening to Mr.
Petry with one car and Mrs.
Hope with the other, Jane rapid.
ly calculated that her madcap
friend’s last three flyers nad
netted her $274.52 and Mr,
Evans $313.29. with his profit
exceeding his cHent's by $38.77.

Jane could bear to see no
more, She quietly closed Mrs.
Hope's recard book, and for her
friend she prayed a silent pray-
er. Her teammate was hehaving
like a pressure cooker without
'@ safety valve.
| Somewhere between Mr.
Petry’s warning and Mrs. Hope’s
wheeling and dealing, Jane de-
cided to take her stand, Appar-
ently, selecting stocks was like
being born and dying; it was
something you had to do alone.

By this time, woefully con-
fused by everybody else's meth-
od, she was ready to devise her
own. As far as she knew, it was
a wholly new way and about
time. It was at least refreshing,
she thought, and it might even
teach the cold canyon of Wall
Street a thing or two about:
purely esthetic pleasure,

Sitting down at her card table
the next morning, Jane began
by grouping the letters of the
alphabet into threes, Then she
matked yellow work sheets
“ABC,” “DEF,” and so on, But
it was the next step—a crucial
one—that showed her passion
for perfection, For her entrics
into their proper alphabetical
categories she fastidiously se-
lected only those stocks whose
names pleased her ear or kindled
her sens¢ of imagery. They had
to do one or the other, and if
they didn't, they .vere rejected
like so many imposters.

On the “ABC” page, she se-
lected Allied Magnolia and then
smiled her satisfaction. “Mag-
nolia” sounded tike Miss
America of the old-fashioned
South and brought to mind pic-
tures of glistening magnolias
and frosty mint juleps, In fact,
for all she knéw about Allied
Magnolia at that point, it could
well have manufactured banjos.

Secrutinizing the B’s one by
one, she had to pass them over
completely, _

The C’s were more rewarding
—especially Cascade Timber,
which sounded rippling, snow-
capped, eternal.

Finally she had a preliminary
ist of 50 stocks that met her
ssthetic standard, and now she
could no longer evade the scc-
ond question: What did these
companies with the alluring
names dof What's more, how
well did they do?

Jane picked up her Stock
Guide for a look behind the
name Allied Magnolia, This ro-

pres Ba a an

 
 in this exchange is devalue the
ruble again, this time by more
than 55 per cent, She hasn't up-
sraded it in terms of gold; she’s
cut it by more than half in terms
of gold.

QQ) The official rate of the old
tuble was 25 cents: sa on a basis
of a one-for-10 exchange, the new
Tuble should be worth $2.50. In-
stead, the value has been placed
at $1.11.

What Russia actually has done
is devalue the ruble in terms of
the dollar from 25 cents to 11
cents — and this, mind you, she
claims is an upward revaluation
in terms of the dollar!

(3) No one can turn in rubles ¢
to the Russian state bank for gold.
Rules against taking rubles out
of the country are exceedingly se-
vere and the Kremlin makes the
rules without consulting any pow-
er In contrast, you can take your
doliars anywhere, spend them as
you will. The freedom of our for-
eign creditors to, exchange their
dollars into gold is, in fact, being
painfully dramatized right now by
the drain on our gold reserves.
The contrast needs no elaboration.

(4) Foreigners holding the old
rubles will be owning nearly
worthless paper unless they can

exchange before the deadline.

Chances are that most rubles

circulating outside the Soviet
are virtually worthless now.

(5) Foreigners living in Moscow
have been handed a 10 per cent
hike in their cost of living as a
New Year's present, for Russia has __
decreed that while one new rublé™
is to be worth 100 kopecks, a tour-
ist can get only 90 kopecks for $1.
imagine the uproar if we did this.

At a time when the stability of
fhe mighty U. S, dollar is being
questioned, the lies about the
‘uble are particularly -infuriating.
While we have held the dollar un-

of the nation’s busiest manufac-
turers of cement products, But
if Jane's gentle soul was dis-
mayed, she was utterly crest~
fallen to find that the jolly nama
of Happy Products actually
stood fot mining machinery.
Stiffening her lip, she saw what
she was up against: The busi«

tive to the alchemy of words.

Next came her final test, as
rigorous aa the first was gentle.
How did her candidates do? For
two days, holding out against
the lines of fine print, she
combed and tabulated earnings
reports in her Stock Guide, It
was a dull, miserable, patience-
taxing job.

She knew what she wanted
—growth stocks only-~of the
type Mr. Petry would call “too
aggressive for a widow.” No
sober-sided slow-movers for

Unfortunately, however,
Jane’s creaky arithmetic proved
@ serious embarrassment to her
research. She had loved to read
about certain companies’ per-

figure percentages for herself.
Thus, feeling unutterably stupid,
Jane’s exercise in stock selec-

That evening, with his usual

teacher — and to their mutual
delight they found that Jane’s
arithmetic came back fast.

The next evening, Al brought
over a slide rule. “This,” he in+
formed her, “will be even bet-
ter. Not necessary, but fun.”

""My percentage gain,” she
told him, “must take off verti-
eally and wobble not at all,
Show me how to use it.”

By the end of an hour Jane
was setting up her problems
with confidence and also flip-~
ping off percentages on the

 ","To the Editor
 ","To the Editor:

I present the following for what
it may be worth. I wish to state
at the outset that I do not want
to win a popularity contest by
such, but feel that some attention
should be focused on the following:

1. The State of Texas is now
spending more money than it is
taking in. As a result of this, there
has been a period when University
paychecks were discounted when
cashed at the bank. I understand
that the banks are now cashing
these checks at face value on the
assumption the State will even-
tually become solvent once more.
If the State cannot pay the prof-
essors, what good will the intra-
mural program or student health
service be in a school with no one
to teach? Good teachers come at
a premium, and Texas can lose
their faculty drawing cards if
they lose sight of their first true
financial responsibility—-which is
to their faculty,

2. If the cost of the Student
Health Services to students were
to increase the number of people
using them would decrease. The
only students there would be those
who really were sick. This would
cut the load on the Health Ser-
vices Staff, and perhaps even re-
sult in an eventual reduction in
the number employed there.

3. The idea that the Intramural
Program or Student Health Ser-
vice are free needs to be done
away with. These services cost
the taxpayers money, and whether
you like it or not they are strict-
ly extras. They are not even sec-
ondary to the primary function of
the University, and if reduction in
those appropriations will help the
financial status of the state, the
University should be willing to
make the sacrifice,

Sincerely,

Gordon Reigle

school.

About 300 of the school’s
2,300 students were involved in

back hall near a black-topped
outdoor assembly area.

Officials of the Orleans
Parish School Board said
police will be stationed at the
school for the remainder of

of the students.

Supt. Gene Geisert said he
hopes to have a proposal
ready for presentation to the
school board when it meets
Monday night that will take a
major step in halting the
racial discord at Abramson.

Meanwhile, school system
administrative personnel are
scheduled to meet with
teachers at Abramson
Thursday during non-teaching
periods, and a meeting is
scheduled with parents for
Thursday night.

Similar meetings have been
held in the past when rioting
broke out at the school.

In Tuesday’s discord, an
equal number of whites and
blacks were reportedly
involved. After police
intervened, the white
students moved toward the
front of the building where
they were dispersed and sent
home. Biacks waited in the
rear of the school until buses
could be brought in to take
them home.

About two-thirds of the
student body left school by
noon, a spokesman for the
school said. Classes continued
for those students who
remained.

No one was reported
injured in Tuesday’s clash,
and no arrests were reported
made.

Geisert said, however, that
any students taking part in
disturbances at the school
during the rest of the week

Labor unions suffered a loss
of 767,000 members, most of
them women, in the United
States during a two-year pe-
riod ending in 1976, the gov-
ernment says.

The Labor Department re-
ported Friday that union
membership totaled 19.4 mil-
lion at the end of last year
compared with 20.2 million
two years earlier. The de-
cline was the first since
1960-62.
 Three million other work-
ers were enrolled in pro-
fessional and state employe
associations, the highest
number ever and an in-
crease of 400,000 from 1974.

The associations, such as
the National Education As-
sociation, generally have
philosophical reservations
about being called a labor
union, but their activities in-
clude conducting collective
bargaining.

Ahoant half the ineraacsa in
 association membership was
on the rolls of the National
Education Association,
which now ranks as the sec-
ond largest single labor or-
ganization in the United
States behindthe
Teamsters, which has 1.8
million members.

The department said the
number of women in labor
organizations, both unions
and associations, declined
by about 50,000 in 1976 from a
peak of slightly more than 6
million in 1974.

This occurred because of a
loss of 400,000 women on un-
ion rolls, and an increase of
350,000 women in associa-
tions, the department said.

Labor Department
analysts said the overall de-
crease of 50,000 may be the
result of heavy unemploy-
ment in industries domi-
nated by women, such as
electronics and the garment
industry.

Another factor, they said,
was that women may have
been low on seniority lists
and were among the first cut
during layoffs.

In response to the report.
 AFL-CIO President George
Meany said o,e reason for
the overall decline in union
membership was that job
growth has been in areas
where the trade union move-
ment has been traditionally
weak, such as in the South.

Unions affiliated with the
AFL-CIO lost 300,000 mem-
bers over the two-year sur-
vey period.

The Labor Department
also noted that employment
in the heavily unionized
manufacturing and con-
struction industries dropped
by 1.4 million over the
1974-76 period.

The combined U.S. union-
association membership
represented 23.2 per cent of
the labor force last year,
compared with 24.5 per cent
in 1974 and 24.7 per cent in
1970.

Twelve large unions with
100,000 or more members re-
ported membership losses
between 1966 and 1976, the
department said. Eight oth-
er unions gained 100,00¢
members or more during the
period, some the result o!
mergers.

Teachers Okay Contract
 ",,"Teachers in the Decatur
County Education Association
ratified a contract Wednesday
night for the coming year
calling for an overall 10.42 per
cent increase in wages and
benefits over the present
agreement.

The contract, which includes
a 7.86 per cent salary hike, will
now be sent to the Decatur
County Community Schools
Corporation Board of Trustees
for final approval at the regular
board meeting Aug. 13.

James Howell, chief
spokesman for the teachers’
contract committee, told the
approximately 40 persons
present at the Decatur County
REMC auditorium for the
ratification meeting that in-
creases in benefits were kept to
a minimum “‘in order to provide
more money for all teachers.”’

The two - year contract,
which can be re - negotiated in
the area of wages next year,
features a $120,000 package of
increases in salaries, as well as
more money for extra duty
compensation, retirement,
mileage allowances and_in-
crement benefits.

Of the $120,000, there was
$90,544 left for salary increases,
which will mean a 7.86 per cent
 increase in the salary levels of
all teachers. The other money
went for paying the other
benefit advancements.

There were no increases in
hospitalization or other major
benefits included in last year’s
contract. Howell told the
teachers that any increased
benefits in these areas would
have to come from the total
$120,000, which would have
 meant a lower pay increase for
individuals.

The contract as ratified was
the result of five meetings with
a federal mediator and
representatives of the county
school administration. Over 50
hours of work went into the total
negotiation process, it was
reported.

The contract sets. the
minimum pay scale for a
 teacher with a _ bachelor’s
degree at $8,436, with the
maximum being $11,321. For
those teachers with master’s
degrees, the minimum will be
$8,652, ranging up to $14,171.

 ",,"10 the eaitor:

The Nov, 15 issue of the
Sun Times included a letter
from a Hyde Parker com-
plaining about being hustled
out of the voting machine
on November 8 before he
was able to complete the
splitting of his ticket, He
stated that both he and his
wife were so mistreated at
the 43rd precinct polling
place (Ray School),

Since this is particularly
(but not peculiarly) a Hyde
Park problem, I should like
to comment on it and its
solution, Ina number of these
precincts, including the
43rd, a very large number
of voters split their tickets
extensively, with the result
that delays of up to an hour
occur on a general election
day. The judges, usually
partisan in their politics, are
not sympathetic to the inde-
pendent voter, especially
when his appearance in force
seriously holds up the elec-
toral process, It is perhaps
understandable that they will
sometimes try to speed up
the voting by “jockeying”
voters through the machines,

In this respect the IVI
performs one of its major
functions, We try to have
 at least one watcher on hand
at all times in each polling
place, with instructions to
make sure no one is intimi-
dated or denied his legal four
minutes in the machine, In
addition, our 1Vi sample bal-
lot, which is normally avail-
able to all Hyde Parkers on
election day, is most useful
in preparing the voter for
his stint in the machine,
He doesn’t have to vote our
choices, but simply mark up
the ballot with his own se-
lections, take it into the
voting machine, and proceed
to pull the levers,

Properly prepared with a
marked sample ballot, aper-
son should take no more than
two minutes in the machine,
regardless of how “split”
is his ticket, With the IVI
watcher on hand to assure
no ‘“jocketying” he should
have no problem with the
election judges,

Unfortunately it is during
relatively quiet general
elections such as the recent
one, when the IVI can be
most helpful to the electo-
rate, that we have the great-
est difficulty recruiting vol-
unteers, Thus coverage ina
particular polling place may
not be complete throughout
 election day.

Some day the IVI may
be able to attract election
day workers on the simple
basis of guaranteeing the full
franchise to one’s neighbors,

Byron Sistler
 8 was the day when a man
named Paul Douglas was
killed politically. Douglas
like the old Negro had met
all the prerequisites of a
good citizen and a noble
public servant and on his
record had a right to ex-
pect his constituents to mark
X as a reward and a “thank
you, Senator Douglas, for
work well done.” Butinstead
they relieved him of his
senatorial toga.

Senator Douglas is learn-
ed, experienced, patriotic
and unmatched in senatorial
decorum. He was not against
the wealthy. He was always
for the weak and poor. He
 was a superior statesman
who had no peers. So when
the white backlash stabbed
him in the back he like the
aged Negro could faintly
mummur, “What have I done
to deserve this?” The an-
swer—you helped the
Blacks, the weak and poor.

Well, you know Christ was
crucified and the devil got
one third of heaven. Often
it seems that reward and
punishment are dispensed in
the wrong directions. Such
is the way of the contest
on many election day. So,
old soldier, I say, “hail but
not farewell!” There’s plenty
of work for you and me in
 this democracy. When a Gage
Park will willingly accept
a known white dope peddler,
but at the same time will
mob Drs. Martin. Luther
King, Percy Julian or Al-
ber B. Falls.

We have plenty of work
to do, senator, when teacher,
preacher, and journalist are
so confused they don’t know
how to justly place blame.
Too often, they would rather
blame the one who tries to
make democracy work than
to blame the mob that puts
democracy on the scaffold.
So, Senator, I say “hail but
not farewell!”

A year ago, the young Qak-
land Athletics’ outfielder was
logking forward to his first
AllStar Game, He was racing
the historic home run paces
of Babe Ruth and Roger
Maris.

This year, however, it’s a
different story.

“I didn’t enjoy playing in
the All-Star game as much
as I enjoyed just being there
to watch it,” he said last
week.

“It’s great to see all those
players together on one field.’'

Jackson -was -the holtest
thing in basebail when the Ail-
Stars gathered last July in
Washington. He had 37 home
rurs at the time and was six
Bames ahead of Maris’ 1961
pace that resulted in a record
61 homers.

Now, he’s just a struggling
24-year-old hitter = ‘in - a
terrible, terrible slump.’’

As the season hit lhe
halfway ""hiark; he had. 12
homers, 34 runs baited in and
was batting .225.

Jackson makes one thing
plain. He plans to return to
allstar stalus as a power
hitter or not at all.

“I've asked Manager John
McNamara. and several other
people if I should cut down
on my swing, They all said
no. , .

“That's not the kind of
hitler I am. P've got to swing
like Harmon Killebrew's, like
Frank Howard's. I've got te
swing like Reggie.”

Jackson's hitting trouble:
actually. began in the Jast hall
of the 1969 season. He hac
aniy 7h hamere after the All.
 Star break. He had 118 RBI
for lhe season and batted .275,

There's no reason why the
‘second half of the scason
can't-be his hot period this
year. he says.

 IN THE SPACE AGE AFFAIRS

A Time For Youth To Be Heard
 ","By HOLMES ALEXANDER
 ","WASHINGTON — Meeting this
week in Washington, the Ameri-
can Rocket Society (ARS) is feel-
ing the push of what we may call
the Kennedy Law of Energy —
namely, youth must have its fling.

Dr. Wernher von Braun, him-
self a youthful rocketeer in his
day, began a personal drive just
a year ago. He was determined
to get the Society to take some
notice of the thousands of Ameri-
can boys who manufacture missil-
es and rockets in their home cel-
lars. These boys mean to test - fly
their craft, willy-nilly, in defiance
of local and national aeronautical
laws.

Erik Bergaust, who has writ-
ten a new von Braun biography,
“Reaching for the Stars,” says
that his hero became seriously in-
terested in youth - rocketry back
in the 1950's when he was receiv-
ing as many as 30 letters a day
from young persons who wanted
to know how to become space
scientists. Along with the letters,
von Braun was receiving news
clips of stories about boys through-
wut the country being killed or
naimed by their experiments.

Intellectual Awakening
Von Braun contends that the
raze did not begin with Sputnik.
le feels that the Space Age crept
pon as unbeknownst. while we
 were thinking of other matters. It

is an intellectual awakening, like
the Renaissance, discovered after
the fact, evidencing itself in many
ways throughout society. 1 know
that Mrs. Lady Bird Johnson, wife
of the incoming Vice President,
has the problem of a young cor-
respondent who wants LBJ, chair-
man of the Space committee, to
insert something or other in the
next orbited nose cone.

We smile — and yet it is not
merely amusing. To von Braun’s
credit, he has taken the matter in
dead earnest. The ARS is a fra-
ternity of scientists: it does not
encourage amateurs. The ARS has
a charter which does not permit
“experimentation.” This would
seem to close the door on high
school rocketeers, but von Braun
will not have it that way. He
first tried to organize an advi-
sory group for boys in his home
in Huntsville, Ala.. — but when
‘experiments’ were forbidden the
boys lost interest in the tame
lectures, field trips and movies.
The group broke up.

Next, von Braun helped organ-
ze a Youth Workshop at Prince-
on, N. J. The main result was
i series of recommendations for a
iational program. Two of the pro-
0sals seem to me to have merit.
 One is that the national pro.
gram be implemented with the
Boy Scouts of America. A pilot
program for proficiency clubs, the
Astronautic Merit Badges and
the Space Explorer Scouts. They
would parallel the present Sea
Scouts and Air Scouts. The other
meritorious proposal is for a Youth
Space Fair. It might be held in
conjunction with the annual meet-
ing of the ARS, and mainly sup-
ported by paid advertising of
Space equipment manufacturers.

Von Braun has done more than
anybody to bring the question of
youth participation in Space-study
out of the realm of Patronization
into that of serious consideration.
He feels that the American Rocket
Society has three choices in
dealing with the undoubted youth
movement in rockets and missiles,
The Society can do nothing, it can
allow the movement to grow
through individual and local in-
terests, or it can take an asser-
tive policy of ‘‘go - forward.”

This last has become almost
the battle cry of the forming Ken-
nedy Organization. There never
was a better time for any worth-
while enthusiasm of young men
and women to get a serious hear-
ng. And this, as everybody must
admit, is a very fine thing in-
leed,

They are waiting today to see if Olds will visit them follow-

discuss the situation.

been working with his staff and legal counsel to comeioa
“peaceful and orderly closure of the tent city situation.” The
tent camping grounds has been set up by the protesters on the
site they want to preserve as a memorial.

ABOUT 6 P_M. a thunderstorm with lightning and high
 winds leveled about two-hirds of the tents. knocking tree
branches down on the site and driving the protesters to better
shelter.

“You can report that up to 150 people are homeless asa
result of this.” one protester joked to a University policeman
afterward. “Maybe we should apply for federal aid.

“Hallelujah.” shouted a small woman in painter pants.
“Tent City shall rise agaiz.”” Her enthusiasim drew some
shouts, clapping and a couple of clenched fist salutes.

Kent officials today estimated damage at $75.00 from the
thunderstorms and high winds which raged through the cam-
pus.

“Part of the roof of the administration building was ripped
off and the entire roof will have te be replaced.’ a KSU spokes-
man said. ““We had some 30 trees heavily damaged. mostly
beyond repair. and nearly 50 windows blown out in campus
buildings — most in Terrace Hail.”

No injuries were reported.

The university statement also said, “Unfortunately rumor.
misinformation and unofficial representations bave created
expectations regarding actions and timetables that have
heightened anxieties and deepened polarity.”

THE STATEMENT said the administration needed more
time thay it had originally planned but said a “legal and peace-
fal resolution” was expected soon.

Olds said in May that the demonstrators would not be ai-
lowed lo remain on the site once construction was ready to

last night by campos police when they went into a dormitory to

Comes To End
 ",,"BELFAST (AP) - The Irish Re-
publican Army’s Provisional wing
broke off its cease-fire Sunday night
after 13 days and renewed its guerrilla
campaign. At least six persons were
killed, and Northern Ireland teetered
on the brink of civil war. ;

The Provisionals charge that British
troops junked the cease-fire by attack-
ing Roman Catholics in Belfast’s Lena-
doon district. William Whitelaw, the
British administrator for Northern Ire-
land, charged that the IRA “set up”
the incident “to provide justification
for resumption of terrorist activity.”
He said the troops were fired on first.
Witnesses backed. the claim.

Sean MacStiofian, chief of staff of
the Provisionals, ordered his gunmen
back to their bullet-and-bomb cam-
paign with “utmost ferocity” to oust
the British army.

Within 15 minutes, firing broke out
all over Belfast. Gun battles raged in
the Catholic Ballymurphy, Ardoyne
and Andersonstown sectors and the
Protestant Springmartin area.

A 100-pound bomb planted in a car
damaged offices downtown. Another
bomb wrecked an all-night garage.
Five bombs exploded within three min-
utes of each other near the Protestant
 warehouse section of Londonderry, the
province’s second largest city. Shoot-
ing erupted around the Bogside, part of
the IRA-ruled ‘‘Free Derry” enclave in
Londonderry.

Carloads of gunmen made hit-and-
run attacks on army posts and am-
bushed patrols, wounding at least four
soldiers.

Six civilians, including a Catholic
priest giving the last rites to another
victim, were killed around the Bal-
lymurphy zone of Belfast. The dead
also included a 13-year-old girl.

The British army claimed one gun-
man was killed and seven others
wounded. But the IRA as usual spirited
all their casualties away.

The truce was shattered when a col-
umn of 2,000 Catholics marched on the
Lenandoon housing project in Belfast
to force resettlement there of 16 Catho-
lic families bombed out of their homes
in a Protestant area.

Squads of the militant Ulster De-
fense Association and other Protes-
tants blocked the marchers and two
trucks loaded with the furniture of the
displaced families. When troops moved
in, the Catholics rained rocks, bottles,
iron bars and gasoline bombs on them.
Nine soldiers and half a dozen civilians
were injured.

The soldiers fired rubber bullets,
tear gas and water cannon at the riot-
ers, then charged them. As the Catho-
lics fell back, a sniper fired a single
shot at the troops.

Within minutes, the troops came un-
der heavy fire from snipers hiding in
the apartment houses. As the battle
widened, the Provisionals announced
the end of the truce.

Security officials feared even blood-
ier religious fighting may be ahead.

ricades it threw up last week in de-
fiance of the British army.

battled at the head of the Gulf of
Aqaba and across the Suez Canal to-
day, with each side accusing the other
of starting the hostilities.

The Israeli army said rockets from
the Jordanian port of Aqaba landed on
the nearby Israeli port of Elath, and
Israeli air force jets quickly retaliated
with an attack on the Jordanian port.

Al Fatah, the Arab __ guerrilla
organization, charged that the Israeli
planes struck first and said its troops
shelled Elath with heavy rockets. in
retaliation. Al Fatah claimed its
rockets heavily damaged  ‘‘vital
installations’ in the Israeli town and
port and killed or wounded a large
number of Israelis.

Meanwhile, Israeli and Egyptian
guns dueled across the Suez Canal
throughout the morning. An attempt
by. U.N. observers to get a cease-fire at
midmorning failed, with Israel and
 Egypt each blaming the other for the
continuation of the fighting.

A Jordanian army spokesman said
eight civilians were killed, including a
woman and four children, and nine
were wounded when two Israeli jets
fired rockets into a residential section
of Aqaba, Jordan’s only port. He said
the wounded included the Belgian
vicar of a Roman Catholic church and
his mother.

The spokesman said the jets damag-
ed 13 houses, a church and girls’
school and a police post. The spokes-
man made no mention of the attack of
Elath and said Jordan was com-
plaining to the U.N. Security Council
about the raid on Aqaba.

An Israeli army spokesman said the
planes were dispatched to silence
rocket launchers’ blasting FElath,
Israel’s gateway to East Africa and
the Far East. The two port towns are
only three miles apart at the head of
 the Gulf of Aqaba.

Thirteen persons were injured, nine
seriously, when the Jordanian rockets
exploded in an apartment complex in
downtown Elath, the Israeli spokes-
man said. One of the injured was a
baby girl, sleeping on a cot. Part of the
roof fell on her, but a thick layer of
blankets gave her some protection.

It was the most serious outbreak on
record in the Elath region, the Israeli-
army spokesman said, and the first
since November.

Israeli Defense Minister Moshe
Dayan, who toured Elath with Chief of
Staff Haim Barlev to inspect the
damage, blamed the Arab guerrilla
organization Al Fatah for the attack but
added: ‘It is clear the responsibility

In Wake of Anti-war Sit-in
 ","Ry ROR SHAPIRO
 ","The General Faculty Council
met in special session last night
and has requested: the Adminis-
tration to “take whatever steps
are necessary to insure the right
of students to meet with the re-
cruiters,” according to a state-
ment issued today. George Lange-
ler, dean of students, said that
these “steps” would include sep-
aration of the demonstrating stu-
dents from the College if they
failed to respond to the demands
of College representatives.”

PRESS TIME BULLETIN

The Administration, in re-
sponse to the Faculty Council’s
request, made arrangements with
 the Air Force recruiters to meet
with all students who wish to
see them in the Office of Gradu-
ate Placement and Counseling,
Peters Hall. At 11 a.m. the re-
cruiters arrived at Peters, where
groups of students, numbering
perhaps 75, had lined up.

Senior Joe Gross, a leader of
the sit-in, said that they would
attempt to “fill up as much of
the recruiters’ time as we can
in order to continue our purpose
— obstructing the recruitment.”
The recruiters talked alternately
with those who supported yes-
terday’s demonstration and those
who are protesting it, or who
simply want to speak to the of-
ficials. At 1:45 p.m. today, three
different groups were present at
Peters Hall. Approximately 150-
200 students were picketing
against the war, not specifically
the recruitment. In addition to
a few still waiting to go into
the Placement Office, about 30
students carried placards out-
side objecting to the denial of
their right of access to the re-
cruiters, which had_ resulted
from the sit-in yesterday. Sen-
ior Joe Friedman, a leader of
this protest, said that many of
his group did, in fact oppose the
war.

The General Faculty Council
met in response to a day-long
sit-in in Wilder Hall yesterday at
which 75 students attempted to
‘refuse access to the recruiters and
therefore “obstruct recruitment
and the perpetration of the Viet-
namese War,” according to senior
Joe Gross, a leader of the dem-
onstration.

Violence Erupts

Violence erupted in the snack
bar in mid-afternoon when dem-
onstrators formed a circle around
one of the recruiters and refused
to admit students into the en-
closure. When members of the cir-
cle locked arms to prevent entry.
some students tried to enter
forcibly. Demonstrators were
wrestled to the ground and were
“choked and kicked” according tc
one demonstrator. Dean Langele1
and the College Police closed the
snack bar at that time in orde
to prevent further violence.

According to the statement cir-
culated by the demonstrator:
throughout the day, the “genera
goal of the demonstration is t
protest the war in Vietnam by;
blocking the armed forces’ recruit:
ing mechanisms here at Oberlin,’
In addition, the demonstrator,
stated that “we strongly resent the
intrusion of the Air Force onto thi

—-A plot to assassinate three mem-
bers of the District Attorney’s office,
discovered last night, only a few
hours after the home of Pete Carlino
Colorado’s “liquor czar,’ had been
dynamited, landed four alleged Den-
ver gangsters in jail.

Earl Wettengel, district attorney,
said the plot contemplated the assas-
sination of Ray Humphreys, Wetten-
gel’s chief investigator; Hugh M.
Woods, Jr., deputy, and Stanley
Maus, investigator.

Those arrested are John DePalme
27; James Pegcelle, 27; Joseph
Lynch, 27, and John Capra, 34.

Wettengel said machine guns had
‘been brought to Denver for. the
triple murder, with the three officers.
scheduled to be killed in true gang-
land fashion.

“This plot was one of the most
carefully planned and sinister schem-
es that has ever come to my atten-
tion,” said the district attorney.
“Some time ago I heard of a plot to
take the lives of some of my deput-
ies. I then called in Denver bootleg-
gers and told them any interference
with members of my office must
cease. Witnesses have told me of the
elaborate plans to ‘get’ Humphreys,
Woods and Maus. These witnesses
knew just where these men would be
at a certain time. The racketeers
were to be in wait for them. The
names of the witnesses cannot be
made public.”

Wettengel said Denver faced a
gang situation similar to that of Chi-
cago, only on a smaller scale.

“Unless an immediate stop is put
to the internal warfare of several
vicious elements, led chiefly by im-
ported gangsters, these elements can
and will be moulded into highly or-
ganized gangs. Such gang organiza-
tions must be killed right now,” said
W ettengel.

“Dear Sir:

“Your popular column is quite correc]
in emphasizing the persistence of pigeons.
But you say nothing about the per-
sistence of gray squirrels, The latter are
not only persistent, but I am convinced
they are in league with Hitler.

“They are playing havoc with the Vic-
tory gardens in our neighborhood. I
had never thought of squirrels eating
tomatoes and cantaloupes, but they are
doing so on a huge scale.

“I saw a squirrel go across my lawn
carrying a tomato that weighed at least
as much as he did, And how do you
explain half a tomato dropping at my
feet out of an pak tree?

“For persistence I'l match my gray
squirrels against your pigeons, and I'll
swap you 8 gray squirrels for about 40
of your pigeons.

“Incidentally, how do you do away
with gray squirrels, especially when they
are so cute and so attractive that one
has not the heart to harm them?

“Sincerely yours, W. La R., Jr.”

Bird feeding and Victory gardens play
into the paws of squirrels.

It is impossible to blame them for
taking advantage of a good opportunity.

‘They will eat almost anything, if hard
pressed for food.

No one who puts out a free lunch can
blame these or any other creatures for
coming.

Yet it is a fact that scores, perhaps
hundreds of Victory gardeners have
grown red in the face over the squirrels.
As red as their own tomatoes.

After all, a few tomatoes or other
edibles will neither make nor break a
garden,

The point is, we believe, that most of
the anger over squirrels and rabbits is
misplaced and wasted.

They do little damage, in the aggre-
gate, but it is not the aggregate, it must
be confessed, which counts with the new
vegetable gardener.

He is so interested in what he is doing,
and so beset by insect enemies and
drought, that the squirrels are simply the
last straws.

Quite lively straws they are, too, as
they whisk around after food.

Wherever there is something good to
eat, a squirrel will find it.

We believe that the entertainment
they give is well worth the little food
they eat.

We advise gardeners, Victory and
otherwise, to calm down about the squir-
rels,

The sight of a grown man shooting
squirrels in a Victory garden, when there
are so many larger and more dangerous
foes loose in the world, is not one to be
Proud of,

The only humane way we know to get
rid of squirrels is to trap them and then
take them across town and let them

W YORK — In the imper-

which our destinies are decid-
ed bird - watching has become
the. most. popular rural sport;
and among local ornithologists
Lyndon, B. Johnson is famed
for his ability to tell) a hawk
from a dove at impressive dis-
tances.

Johnson professes __ himself
concerned by the American pre-
valence of hawks. He is not

to his Vietnam policy emanat-
ing from the so - called liber-
al left for, according to White
House naturalists, this main-
tains’ a constant population lev-
el little more menacing than
the pigeons in the capital's
spacious parks.

What does worry the chief
bird - watcher is the hawks,
that growing, angry, rapacious

\ces and gestures seem to then:
Jace what remains of interna

“Look at that view,”’ said the

The view, of course, was <

was absolutely the — greates'
 Vietnam policy to which both
doves and hawks object alth-
ough for opposite reasons; But
by the time the bombing pause
and the first Fulbright hearings

dropped to 49 per cent.

Truckers Block Highways
 ","By The Associated Press
 ","By The Associated Press

Truckers protesting higher
diesel fuel prices and lower
speed limits blocked highways
in four states today. There
were warnings that the shut-
down could spread across the
nation.

Authorities reported at least
two arrests in the initial pro-
tests,

“There’s all kinds of talk all
over the nation, mostly among
the drivers,” said William J.
Hill, president of the Fraternal
Association of Speciality Haul-
ers which says it represents
alout 250,000 independent
truckers,

SHUTDOWN

“Officially we're not advocat-
ing any national shuidown,” he
said, adding that the drivers
were using their citizens’ band
raaio network and “talking up
the idea of a shutdown.”

William A. Bresnahan presi-
dent of the American Trucking
Association said neither the as-
sociation nor its members was
involved in “this disruption of
traffic. We do not condone it
and, in fact, deplore it.”

“While there will be prob-

lame tn ha fanad with a KE
 rererring tO te proposed MNa-
tionwide limit, ‘‘we support the
President in his eiforts to alle-
viate the fuel shortage which
ine country faces.
SACRIFICES

“All will have to make some
sacrifices, if we are to weather
the present energy crisis and
ihe trucking industry is pre-
pared to do its part in this ef-
“tort.”

The first demonstration was
reported in Pennsylvania, on
Interstate 80 near Blakeslee,
where truckers stalled traffic
for five hours, finally ending
their protest at 3 a.m.

Other stoppages were report-
ed in Ohio, West Virginia and
New Jersey with some of the
 same drivers apparently in-
volved in more than one pro-
test.

A Teamsters Union spokes-
man in Washington said he did
not know whether the stoppages
were part of a coordinated ef-
fort. “There's 19 million trucks
and there’s 400,000 teamsters
that drive,’ he said, adding
that he had no way of knowing
whether the protesters were un-
ion members or not.

POSTS BOND

J.W. Edwards of Overland
Park, Kan., one of the truckers
involved in the Pennsylvania
protest, said that if the drivers’
demands were not met by mid-
December there would be a na-
tionwide truck stoppage on the
 highways.

There were no arrests in the
Pennsylvania or New Jersey
protests.

Near Cambridge, Ohio, Rob-
ert Gallicchio, 25, of Highland
Park, N.J., refused to move off
the highway and was arrested
for illegally parking on the
highway. He posted bond and
was released,

DIRT UNDER FEET

Authorities in West Virginia
Said a group of truckers briefly
blocked traffic on the west-
bound entrance to Interstate 70.
One driver, Walter Barclay of
Omaha, Neb., was arrested for
blocking a road, was fined and
released.

 was not immediately available.

Barclay later drove into Ohio
and said he was one of the
drivers involved in the Cam-
bridge protest, which started at
about 7 a.m., in the westbound
lanes on Interstate 70.

“A truck driver right now is
 just dirt under peoples’ feet,”
said Barclay who confirmed the
West Virginia arrest.

The Ohio Highway Patrol
said traffic was backed up for
two miles at the height of the
Cambridge demonstration
which involved about 60 trucks.

 Most Protesters At N.H. Nuclear Site
Remain In Custody Of Authorities
 ",,"PORTSMOUTH, N.H. (AP) —
Hundreds of anti-nuclear power
demonstrators remained in con-
finement Monday in four armories
across the state and some who were
released complained bitterly about
their treatment.

Several demonstrators taken from
the construction site of a nuclear power
plant in Seabrook on Sunday said many
of them were held in National Guard
trucks for up to 15 hours without food or
water. :

The demonstrators, who put an
estimated 2,000 men and women onto
the plant site Saturday for the 24-hour
‘“‘“occupation,’’ said further sit-ins
would take place in even greater
numbers.

Robin Read, a spokesman for the
sponsoring Clamshell Alliance, said,
“If the Public Service Co. continues
building that plant, then eventually
we'll have to be back with 18,000
 people.”
Excavation continued Monday by

more than 250 construction workers
who entered the site that had been
cleared by the authorities.

The arrested demonstrators were
funneled through the Portsmouth
armory 16 miles north of Seabrook
where four judges worked through the
night and into late Monday to arraign
them on trespass charges.

Reporters were barred from areas

where the demonstrators were held,
but officials said 1,414 had been

arrested. Roland Jenkins, Gov.
Meldrim Thomson’s press secretary,
said earlier that about 1,200 had been
arraigned on various charges. But
Clamshell asserted that as many as
1,800 may have been arrested. About
half were held at the armory in
Manchester, the rest in Portsmouth,
Somersworth and Dover.
Demonstrators against the proposed
 seacoast nuclear plant accused
Thomson of intervening in the legal
process.

Read said most demonstrators had
declined bail because authorities ‘‘have
been very arbitrary in the way they’ve
treated people.”

Bail ranged from _ personal
recognizance to $500 in cash, but
Clamshell spokesman said “only a
handful’’ of demonstrators were
released. Official figures on the
number released were unavailable and
court authorities only would say that
hearings would be held as soon as they
could be arranged.

Raymond Laporte, 25, said on his
release on bail from the Portsmouth
armory that he stayed in the back of a
military truck from 8:30 p.m. Sunday,
when he was taken from. the
construction site with about 20 others,
until his arraignment at 11:30 a.m.
Monday.

He said he received no food nor water
and when he asked to make a phone call
was told there were no phones in the ar-
mory.

Neither Thomson, state Atty. Gen.
David Souter, nor county prosecutors
were available to discuss the
demonstrators’ charges.

Laporte said he was not advised of his
rights when he was arrested.

Several reporters among a group of
journalists arrested also said they were
not told of rights as required by the U.S.
Supreme Court.

Demonstration leaders had praise,
however, for the peaceful manner in
which the arrests were made Sunday
and Monday. No violence or injuries
were reported.

ratists holding 106 children and
six teachers in a country school
fired two bursts of shots into

speed up delivery of breakfast.
Anger was growing among par-
ents in the town.

The extremists, who also held
as many as 80 persons on a hi-
jacked train, demanded release
of 2t jailed countrymen and
asked for a jumbo jet to take
them out of the country by
Wednesday.

“AS far as we know, none of
the children was hurt. The
shots were just lo keep us on
our loes,”” a police spokesman
said after the automatic weap-
ons fire echoed from the village
schoo! in nearby Bovensmilde.
 Six terrorists were believed in-
side.

About 10 miles away, just
north of this northern Dutch
city, a second band of seven
South Moluccans held hostages
aboard a train. Police sharp-
shooters had the train and
schoal surrounded, but a gov-
ernment official said “the risk
was to high"" to storm either lo-
cation.

Tension heightened among
the parents and other villagers
in Bovensmilde. “We're sharp-
ening the knives.” said Mrs.
{na Smit, 58. “These people will
accept a lot of nonsense but
when you touch their children
it’s like putting a knife in their

The gunmen fired shots at 9
a.m. te alert police they wanted
breakfast, and again shortly
after 10 a.m. before the food
arrived. A second food delivery
was made at noon.

Government officials said the
terrorists, who seized the train
and school Monday morning.
demanded a jumbo jet to fly
them, the freed prisoners and
some hostages out of the coun-

try.

They set a deadline of 2 p.m.
local (8 a.m. EDT) Wednesday
and threatened to kill their hos-
tages if the government at-
tempted mediation, Dutch radio

reported.
It was believed that among
 the prisoners whose freedom
they sought were 14 South Mo
luccans jailed after a similar
twin terrorist strike in Decem-

gangs commandeered a train
and occupied the Indonesia con-

Dutch government help them
win independence from In-

Four hostages were killed.

The extremists did not speci-

has a range of more than 6.000

 A medical official reported
that medicines accepted by the
gunmen at the school Monday
night included a special pre-
scription for a girl suffering
from a heart condition. “If she
does not have this her life will
be in danger,"" he said, adding
she needed five doges a day.

A special package of toys and

in Beirut streets
 ","By MICHAEL ROSS
 ","BEIRUT, Lebanon (UPI) —
Christian gunmen held onto a
shrinking defense perimenter
in Beirut’s most expensive
hotel district today, fighting a
last ditch battle against
becoming totally surrounded
by Moslem militia.

Premier Rashid Karami
called a new cease-fire Friday
night — the 11th in seven weeks
— but like the others it im-
mediately collapsed.

Christian and Moslem
militias fought into the early
morning hours with rockets,
mortars, and machine guns.

At least 30 persons were
killed and about 70 wounded
Friday, raising the toll in seven
weeks of city-wide warfare to
more than 1,000 dead and 2,500
wounded.

Christian militiamen of the
right-wing Phalangist party
made a last-stand defense
against Moslem leftists ad-
vancing from two sides on their
embattled positions inside the
St. George Hotel and the
Holiday Inn in the resort area.

Fierce rocket, mortar and
machine gun clashes also raged
through the city’s devastated
 eastern outskirts.

Leftists pushed the
Christians out of the streets
north of Hamra, the main
uptown shopping center, and
advanced east and south to
within 100 yards of the Holiday
Inn, where they traded
machine gun and rocket fire
with Phalangists holed up in-
side.

The Phalangists were
fighting desperately to retain
the hotel, the streets in back of
it, and the port road that is the
one access route left to them to
their headquarters downtown.

The area just south of the
Holiday Inn, one of the
wealthiest Christian areas of
Beirut, was patrolled today by
Moslem gunmen who assured
the few remaining residents
they had nothing to fear
because the area had been
“liberated.”

Walter Krause, a West
German living near Clemen-

steer it iito another budget éategory, ho

‘ Premature commitments may ‘also
propel a school board into the position of
detually spending more money than it
might otherwise have to spend. A few
years ago in Hayward: Unified, for in-
stance, the schoo! board spent a lot of
time in the spring telling teacher
that the board would be only too glad to.
beef up teacher salaries, if it only had the
money. -When a million-dollar windfall

board had to blow the whole thing on sal-

seratching for money again, with at least
some members wishing they hadn’t been
86-prodigal in spending the windfall.

Most of these problems could be elimi-
nated if the state would adopt some sen-
sible appropriation practices that would
dovetail with the budgeting timetables of
school districta.

School districts must do their budg-

eting in a virtual vacuum, as far as
knowledge of state income ia concerned.
Their spending plans must be buttoned
down by mid-summer, at the latést, and
in recent years that’s been about the
time the Legislature geta busy with the
emergency legislation, following its own
budget adoption, geared to keeping
schools afloat.
1. This pattern does lénd itself to special
pleading for whatever extra funds’ be-
come available by well-organized groups
within the school system. Because every-
thing about the arrangement has a panic-
ky character; spending new money does
not receive the sober deliberation that it
should. ; ;

Proposals that school boards commit
such money in advance might eliminate
some of the last-minute pulling and tug-
ging, but only by substituting premature
pressuring of trustees.

by strike at 2 a. m. Monday morn-

Oil Workers International Union,
CIO, walked off the job.

The strike was called after nego-
tiations over wage increases and
other union demands broke down.
Plant Manager Kenneth D. Bowen
said the union asked 30-cent an
hour increases for all workers and
rejected a company offer of 15-
cent boosts. Also at issue were
union demands for sick leave, sev-

non-union supervisors will continue
to work at plant maintenance and
about 150 clerical workers will
stay on the job, he said.

set up when the night shift of
about 80 workers walked out, have

 ",,"In the light of difficulties experienced by par-
ents in providing new books for their children this
year, the statement of the Alabama School Jour-
nal, official organ of the Alabama Education As-
sociation, that this state needs a better method of
selecting and adopting school textbooks seems to
be well founded. “The need has been suggested
from time to time,” The School Journal says, “but
the recent adoption of boeks for each of the 12
grades of the public school system has driven
home this need in the most effective manner pos-
sible--by way of the pocketbook.”

Two serious objections to the present method,
which causes all the books used in the public
schools to be changed at the same time, are cited.
One complaint {s that selections necessarily are
hurried and another is that the immediate costs
to parents {s too heavy, particularly in times of
financial stress such as have been felt in Ala-
bama and elsewhere for the last several years.

Under the present plan, it is noted, the father
who must buy complete sets of books for several
children is called upon to put down a considerable
sum, for textbooks are invariably sold for cash,
and that in many instances causes a real hard-
ship. As a remedy a “stagger system” of adopting
books is sucgested and it is considered likely that
this will be proposed to the Legislature when it
reconvenes. In any event it would’ seem that a
change is in order, whether it be the plan offered
by educational leaders or some other.

in New York City
 ",,"By The Associated Press

New York City obtained a
court order today to halt a
twoday wildcat strike by
sanitationmen which has left
more than 30,000 tons of
garbage piled up on city
streets in the sweltering July
heat, but it was not im-
mediately clear whether the
men would return to work.

The order came as the
city’s firemen began to report
in sick in large numbers and
police threatened a job action
of their own to protest the
dismissal of 19,000 city
workers under Mayor
Abraham OD. Beame’s
pruned-down $12.1-billion
budget.

In Pennsylvania, a strike
by state workers entered its
second day with virtually all
state agencies disrupted,
arrests rising and an attempt
under way to resume con-
tract talks.

And strikes for higher
wages by 5,000 public em-
 ployes in Northern California
went into the second day.

A ‘‘partial’’ health
emergency was declared in
connection with the garbage
pileup in New York City.

State Supreme _ Court
Justice Thomas J. Hughes
issued a temporary
restraining order barring a
continued strike by
sanitationmen, saying ‘“‘the
health and safety of the city’s
residents must be of first con-
sideration.”

John DeLury, head of the
Uniformed Sanitationmen’s
Association, said his mem-
bers were acting on their own
in refusing to pick up the
garbage. Sanitation Com-
missioner Robert Groh said
that if that were so it was
“the best organized wildcat
strike I’ve ever seen.”’

Arrangements were made
for emergency collections at
hospitals, nursing homes and
day care centers.

Meanwhile, firemen were
renortingo ciek in ‘*‘1yMniicnallyv
 high’’ numbers, a spokesman
said.

The firemen lost a legal
battle as State State Supreme
Court Justice Geroge Stark
rejected a suit seeking to stop
the city from dismissing 2,300
firemen because of the fiscal
Crisis.

In Pennsylvania, a_ state
police spokesman said there
have been 17 arrests since the
walkout began at midnight
Monday. Charges included
obstructing highways and
entrances, rock throwing,
disorderly conduct and
malicious mischief.

Welfare offices, unemploy-
ment offices and general and
mental hospitals all
remained open with super-
visory personnel and in some
cases volunteers manning
positions. Most state parks
remained closed.

Liquor stores were open as
retail clerks extended their
contract.

The state Justice Depart-
ment went to court today to
argue for returns of workers
at mental hospitals.

In the sprawling neighbor-
hoods of the city, residents
watched the refuse piles grow
and reacted variously with
resignation, anger, or bit-
terness. Some worried that
youngsters would set fire to
the piles.

“It’s terrible, but what can
you do,’’ said the wife of an
apartment house superinten-
dent in Astoria, Queens.

“I pile the garbage up
neat,’’ said Antonio Escevec,
a building superintendent in
the South Bronx. ‘But it will
stink and I think it will be
very dirty. I pile it up right
outside my bedroom window,
and at night I lie awake. The
kids, you know, will set fire to

‘Republican’ state
legislators in Albany refused
on Tuesday to give New York
Mayor Abraham D. Beame
new taxing powers to raise
money for city coffers. He
was forced to order the firing
of 19,000 municipal employes,
among them nearly 3,000 of
the city’s 10,600  sani-
tationmen.

Vowing that New York
would become “Stink City,”’
Uniformed Sanitationmen’s
Association president John J.
DeLury warned that if any of
his men were laid off, the rest
would refuse to work. The
union followed through on the
threat, staging a wildcat
strike. DeLury said he had
lost control of his men.

In poorer neighborhoods
the refuse grew in fetid heaps
and residents worried about
the potential health hazard of
garbage rotting under a
sweltering July sun. Others
were concerned that youths
would set it afire, posing yet
another danger.

1 great pleasure, but the thing as a whole seeme
t to me to have certain implications, and the impl

_'more explicit.
1} Along about the very darkest days of the d

2 Revue, as an art form, seemed to have come at las
- into its own and to give promise of rare things i

ful first “Little Show.” Certainly things cam
quickly to a head in those two magnificent fandar
*|gos, “Three’s A Crowd” and “The Band Wagon.
The knockabout vaudeville sketches and the bed
zened display which had had such a strangle hol
on the endless parade of “Follies,” “Scandals” an
“Vanities” of the twenties seemed at last to hav
been replaced by wit, taste, intelligence and beaut:
|The Revue had ceased to be glorified music hal
with no aim save to please the mythical “tired bus

ness man,”

and had become—what by its nature -
was eminently suited to be—a graceful instrumen
.}for supplying a comment on the times. Instea
of the old pseudo-smutty bedroom scenes we ha
such things as the unforgettable “Private Life of
Roxy Usher,” the whole kit and caboodle of satiri
. delights that Howard Dietz and George S. Kaufma
| wrote for Max Gordon’s “Band Wagon.” Instea
‘of the old tawdry production numbers, with hund
reds of feather-wrapped chorines parading, a l
“Folies Bergeres,’’ up endless Stairways of Lov
to a tinseled niche where lay, comfortable in a smi]
and a vast headdress, a nymph labeled the Goddes
of Beauty in Act I and the Goddess of Love, an
Flame, in (respectively) Scenes 5 and 13 of Act I
we had such simple and moving beauty as th
|“Hoops” number of “The Band Wagon,” the un
|matchable ‘Louisiana Hayride” finale of “Flyin
.|Colors.”
But today the promise of ’30 and ’32 seems t
|have come to nothing. Since Mr. Harris’ lustrou
‘As Thousands Cheer” we have had no revue worth
|of wholehearted admiration. The decline, as far a
I can see, began when the Shuberts, rescuing th

‘|grant them that) than the predepression Winte

 ",,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Viet-
nam protesters have won the
right to march down Pennsylva-
nia Avenue—a street the gov-
ernment had insisted was off
limits—but will avoid the White
House, once a prime target of
their demonstrations.

The Veterans Day armistice
hammered out Tuesday with top
Justice Department officials
ended a month-long battle and
paved the way for what both
sides now say will be a massive.
but peaceful demonstration.

The government is “not giv-
ing anything to which the people
are not entitled,’ said one dem-
onstration leader, Ron Young.
But, he added: ‘‘We're basically
happy and ready to move now. °

As Young spoke at a news
conference Tuesday night, Atty.
Gen. John N. Mitchell under-
scored the administration's
viewpoint, telling a Milwaukee
audience that ‘the foreign poli-
cy of this government cannot
and will not be formulated in
the streets of Washington—or in
 any other street of this nation.

But. added Mitchell, ‘‘this ad-
ministration clearly recognizes
the right of these people under
our First Amendment to peace-
fully congregate in Washington
and to petition the government
with respect to their grievances
—assumed or otherwise.”

The march sponsors, the New
Mobilization Committee to End
the War in Vietnam, had de-
manded permission to swing
past the White House on their
march down Pennsylvania Ave-
nue from the Capitol to the
Washington Monument.

Now the marchers—perhaps
as many as 200,000 in what
could be the biggest antiwar
protest in history—will turn off
the broad avenue at 15th Street,
a block short of the White
House, and head for the monu-
ment to climax three days of
demonstrations.

Mayor Walter E. Washington
and Deputy Atty. Gen. Richard
G. Kleindienst, who last Thurs-
day declared that ‘‘under no
 conditions” could Pennsylvania
Avenue be used, said the gov-
ernment agreed to the route aft-
er the New Mobilization gave
assurances of an orderly dem-
onstration.

Asked if they were disappoint-
ed at not being allowed to bring
the mass protest directly in
front of the White House, pro-
test leaders referred instead to
their 40-hour ‘‘March Against
Death.” They plan this protest
to send demonstrators single-
file from Arlington Cemetery
past the White House and to the
Capitol beginning Thursday
night and ending Saturday
morning. The Justice Depart-
ment has not objected to this.

The department had refused
permission for a permit on
Pennsylvania Avenue on _ the
grounds it would be difficult to
control any outbreaks of vio-
lence near the street’s business
areas.

Instead, the department of-
fered to let the march proceed
from the Capitol down Constitu-
 tion Avenue to the mall behind
the White House. This route
would have been roughly paral-
lel to Pennsylvania Avenue, but
about one block south.

Kleindienst said the New Mo-
bilization Committee ‘‘offered
every assurance that order will
be maintained during the Nov.
15 march.

“We have accepted that as-
surance and demonstrated our
good faith by granting a permit
for one of the routes the com-
mittee chose for its march,”’ he
said.

The compromise was reached
after days of negotiations and
came only hours after a Veter-
ans Day crowd of 10,000 rallied
at the monument grounds to de-
nounce the demonstrators and
shout support for Nixon and his
Vietnam policy.

The agreement calls for the
New Mobilization Committee to
provide 2,000 parade marshals
to keep demonstrators on the
south side of Pennsylvania Ave-
nue and another 500 marshals to
 keep crowds away from govern-
ment buildings on the other side
of the thorofare.

Meanwhile, the government
went ahead with plans of its
own to maintain order.

A small advance party from
the 82nd Airborne Division ar-
rived from Ft. Bragg, N.C., to
prepare for possible movement
of paratroopers to the capital.
 Pentagon spokesmen indicated
a light brigade of between 1,500
and 2,000 paratroopers may be
brought up before the weekend.

But the primary role for con-
trolling any disorders at the out-
set will fall to the civilian police
and the District of Columbia
National Guard. About 500
Army guardsmen will report to
their armories Friday night,
 with another 1,500 or so Army
and Air Force guardsmen com-
ing on duty Saturday.

Some will be deployed to pro-
tect fire stations and equipment,
others will replace policemen in
precincts around the city to free
the civilian policemen for other
duties, while others will be de-

carried placards advocating
open housing.

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.,
who was struck by a rock while
the parade was forming, headed
back to Atlanta Saturday. He
planned to go from there to
 Jackson, Miss., for next week's
convention of the Southern
Christian Leadership  Confer-
ence (SCLC), of which he is
chairman,

His associates scheduled a
prayer vigil for Sunday in the
Belmont-Cragin section of the
Northwest Side, where they
walked a gantlet of jeers and
taunts on two previous visits.

Supt. O. W. Wilson, whose
heavy concentrations of po'ice
have kept aroused whites from
closing in on the demonstrators
in both neighborhoods, appealed
to all citizens to help maintain
‘law and order, He asked people
to stay away from disturbec
areas.

“Repetition of illegal acts,”
he warned, ‘will continue to
result in swift arrests.”’
 Alderman John J. Hoellen, a
Republican who represents the
47th Ward on the North Side,
said he had sent a letter to
Democratic Mayor Richard J.
Daley, calling for a halt to the
marches.

‘Events of the past week,’’ he
said, “have demonstrated that a
continuation of these marches
constitutes a direct menace to
Public safety.”

In one of the latest outbreaks
lof violence, two white teen-ag-
ers were founded in a fight
with four young Negroes Friday
night at a drive in restaurant
at 103rd Street and St. Law-
rence Avenue on the far South
Side.

rested later and charged with

Editor, Tribune:

It apparently seems that there
must be some member of the Work-
ets Alliance either has a guilty con-
science or a shady past record, after
reading the article ""WORKERS AL-
LIANCE HITS NATION-WIDE
FINGERPRINT DRIVE.”

As far as the project being a foolisn
setup and spending money whic
could be of more benefit to the needy
in some other way, there are other
projects that benefit the public in
Beneral as little. if not less. There has
been no complaint made by the
Workers Alliance concerning these
projects when sponsored by the WPA
depriving the needy of food and
clothing.

Therefore I cannot but believe that
there must be at least one member of
the Alliance with a shady record and
Who is teluctant about having his
fingerprints put on record and later
examined by the federal government.

The WPA does not compel or Je-
mand anyone to have his fingerprints
taken. They merely ask people to
volunteer as subjects for that project.
(The Fngerprint Drive.)

One does not jeopardize his job or
Teputation unless, sometime in the
past, one has committed a crime or
violated the laws of our country.

My opinion is that if there has ever
been any attempt of oppression by
any organization or members it has
been noted most in the Workers Al-
lignce in this city.

AW INTReCOrcn tyros. wragcecns
 kept out of it. Just why was that?
Let me answer that question for you:
They attended to their own business,
{did not think as much of dollars as
j they did of their boys’ lives and did
hot provoke any of the powers en-
gaged in that war to the point of
attack, as we did. We thought of
money and money only. We had a
man at the head of our government
who could not take a mild insult and
did not have courage enough to tell
American citizens to travel on Amer-
ican ships, He did not have to go to
the front—I only wish he had—but.
he did not, and it was easy for him'
to tell the other fellow to go out and |
fight his battles. It requires but little
‘courage to tell your neighbor to go
over and whip the devil out of some
other neighbor, but it does take cour-
age to say “watch me, Iam going to
do that little trick myself.” The lat-
ter is the man who never stirs up
wars. The one who fights them never
hes anything to do with stirring them
up. Now Mr, Hitler says he would
like a fight, and I, for one, would like
to see him get it-—right in the neck.
‘too-and then, after the smoke of!
that battle cleared away, he would
not be so anxious to get into another |
war, I would like to see the time
come when every man who agitates
‘the war spirlt—unless we are in-'
vaded—had to take a gun and go to
the front. How many do you think
now in the city of Washington—the
source from whence all wars emanate
—would vote for war if they had to
fight them? Not one is my guess.
Now if this war hysteria is about to
break out again in this country, why
cannot all good editors and ministers
of the gosp2l begin right now and
Keep at it until this war talk becomes
so obnoxious that no decent man or
woman will lsten to it, Why not
every minister of the gospel begin
right mow—take time by the fore-
lock—and preach a good sermon on
‘Thou shalt not kill"" and show to
the world that they actually care
more for human life than for mam-
mon. If they do that and are assisted
by the editors and by the women of
this country who furnish the can-
non fodder, there will never be an-|
other war that we will get inte un-|
Jess and. unhil we are invaded by 2;
foreign enemy.

It is my best judgement that when '
God said “Thou shalt not kill"" he|
did not mean that it was all right:
to murder on the wholesale scale but’
that it would be wrong to kill one!
ats time. The Bible also says, “All
that 8 man hath will he give for his)
life’ and that too is true. Let us|
save ives if we can and to do that)
we must enlist the greatest powers!
on the earth, which are the public '
press, the churches and the women |
who raise the boys ho are to be;
murdered. |

sent to strife-torn Montgomery, Ala.. This will bring
the number there to between 600 and 700.

Kennedy said many of the marshals now there have
been up for 48 hours, that Alabama is a large state, and
that the Justice Department wants to be sure enough
marshals are there.
 MONTGOMERY, Ala, -- Racial-
ly troubled Montgomery lay under
a protective cover of martial rule
today after the second wild out-
break of rioting in a bloody
weekend.

There were sporadic incidents
of continued violence—including
two house-burning attempts —
hours after steel-helmeted troops
with fixed bayonets took com.
mand. But the major violence
had subsided, for the time at
least.

Spend Night in Church

An estimated 1,000 Negro wor-
shippers spent much of the night
in a church auditorium in protec-
tive custody after a howljng mob
of white men had tried to get to
them.

About two hours before daylight
guardsmen drove three National
Guard trucks to the church, load-
ed 25 to 30 persons from the con-
gregation in each truck, and took
them home.

Then about 4 am. guardsmen
told all those remaining they
jcould leave. They streamed out
‘in the early morning quiet, got
‘into their cars, and drove off.

By 5 am. (CST) the church
area was deserted exceg@ for 25

| “we don’t anticipate any: further

arrival in Montgomery on a se-
gregation-testing challenge Satur-
day touched off repeated attacks
| by club-swinging white men and

>
 It was the Sunday night upris-
ing which provoked Gov. John M,
Patterson to proclaim ‘‘qualified
martial rule’’ and give troops un-
ider Adj. Gen. Henry V. Graham
sweeping powers to take what-
ever action necessary to restore
; order,

The governor previously had
| protested bitterly against U. §S,
_Atty. Geen. Robert Kennedy's or-
der to rush more than 500 armed
U. §. marshals and deputies to
Monigomery to prevent further
interference with the bus riders.

In a tense, face-to-face meeting
with Kennedy's top assistant, By-
ron R. Whitee, the state’s chief
executive threatened to jail fed-
eral officers who sought to exert
‘their authority in the absence of
a request for federal help.

Patterson in his proclamation of
martial law still insisted that the
self-styled “freedom riders’’—he
‘called them “agitators’—were te
(blame for the race rioting be-
| cats of their insistence on test-
| ing bus station racial barriers.
| But, he decreed, “there now
;exists .. , a serious emergency,
|a defiance of the constitution and
laws of Alabama. a state of law-
lessness .. . which the local of-
ficers are unable to subdue.”

Backed in Congress

Congressional leaders, mean-
while, generally supported Atty.
Gen. Kennedy's dispatch of the
marshals. They said there seemed
to be no alternative. Even South-
ern members deplored the vio-
lence. One said it would make his
role at the Capitol more difficult.

Despite angry federal - state
bickering earlier in the day, US.
officers worked alongside city and
state police and the battle-trained
guardsmen after Patterson or-
dered out the troops.

Even the bus riders won a re-
prieve from the threat of arrest
on charges of violating a state
court injunction which had sought
to stop them from riding a bus
here from Birmingham.

Sheriff's deputies holding con-
tempt of court warrants turned
them over to Col. Herman Price,
who assumed the military office
of sheriff under the martial rule.

Gen. Graham, entering the Ne-
gro chyrch after the National
Guardsmen arrived, ordered them
there through the night for their
protection while troops patrolled
the streets.

Scattered Resistance

Outside, scattered pockets of re
sistance to the law-and-order de-
cree released their pent-up fury,
They overturned a parked auto
mobile, tossed a rock at Police
Commissioner L. B. Sullivan's
car, sent police chasing down re-
ports of shots fired at Negro
houses.

While the rioting raged at the
Negro church, the mob surged
past federal marshals and city
and state police, tossing rocks
and bricks. Several persons were

tinjured, but none seriously.

The main force of the crowd
had been’ blunted by tear gage
when National Guardsmen rum-
bled up in Army trucks.

While state authorities held
|warrants for the arrest of the
“freedom riders’ on contempt ci-
tations, a federal court injunction
went into effect over the weekend
to protect interstate bus riders
from further interference,

ends in capital
 ",,"By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

WASHINGTON — Public
schoolteachers in Washington,
D.C., have accepted a contract
containing an immediate 7 per
cent pay raise, ending a two-
week strike of the 140,000-pupil
school system in the nation’s
capital.

Classes are expected to re-
Sume today, one day after
teachers agreed to a contract
that also provides for an addi-
tional 5 per cent raise next Sep-
tember and immunity from re-
prisals for the strike.

The new pay scale for teach-
ers with a bachelors degree
ranges from $8,350 starting to a
maximum of $12,965, compared
to the old range of $7,800 to
$12,070. Teachers with masters
degrees will receive from $9,190
to $14,930, compared to the old
$8,580 to $13,900.

The 7,500 teachers lost union
sponsored demands for teacher
control of the school system
and for service charges from
nonunion teachers to the union.
They won a promise for better
equalization of class sizes.
 Elsewhere, three leaders of a
teachers strike in Beacon,
N.Y., went to jail Monday while
four leaders of striking Bur-
lington, Mass., teachers were to
be released today from the
Middlesex County Jail after
serving one-week terms.

The Beacon strike was settled
last week but State Supreme
Court Justice John F. Donohoe
fined the leaders of the Beacon
Teachers Association and or-
dered them to jail for up to 15
days for not complying with a
court injunction to stop the
strike.

The jailed leaders of the 470-
member Burlington Educators
Association, the union, planned
to go right from jail to a meet-
ing of the full union member-
ship to discuss proposals for
settling the 13-day walkout.

Strikes also continued Mon-
day in school systems at Ra-
cine and Muskego-Norway, Wis.
There were no negotiations in
the week-old Racine strike,
while some progress in nonmo-
netary matters was reported in

The flight not only demonstral-

portance of the bases abroad
against which Russia futrninates se
heartily.

The Air Force refused to say

Today is Friday, Nov. 15,
the 319th day of 1974. There
are 46 days left in the year.

Today’s highlight in his-

tory:
On this date in 1777, the
Articles of Confederation
were approved by the
American Continental
Congress. The document
was the law of the land until
the Constitution went into
effect.

In 1492, Christopher Col-
umbus noted in his journal
the use of tobacco among
the Indians. It was the first
recorded reference to to-
bacco.

In 1805, the Lewis and
Clark expedition reached
the mouth of the Columbia
River after a long trek ac-

ross the West.
' Ir 1806, Pike’s Peak in
Colorado was discovered
by explorer Zebulon Mont-
gomery Pike. ;

In 1889, the Republic of
Brazil was founded.

In 1935, Manuel Quezon
was inaugurated as the
first president of the
Philippine Common-
wealth.

In 1970, thousands of per-
sons were killed in a
typhoon and tidal wave in
East Pakistan,

Ten years ago: The U.N.
Security Council said it
would meet in urgent ses-
sion at the request of Israel
and Syria to consider an
outbreak of hostilities on
the border between the two
countries, .

Five years ago: A qyar-
ter of a million protestors
against the Vietnam War
‘staged a peaceful demonst-
ration in Washington, D.C.

One year ago: Israel and
Egypt began an exchange
of prisoners after a cease-
fire in the October 1973 war.

Today‘s birthdays: Dip:

in Good Friday observance
 ",,"JERUSALEM (AP) — Thousands of
Christian pilgrims carried heavy crosses
through a sand storm today in the annual
Good Friday procession to Calvary.

Jewish soldiers with assault rifles wat-
ched from the rooftops and patroled the
streets as the procession followed the Way
of the Cross through the narrow
alleyways of the Via Dolorosa.

Security precautions were the heaviest
in years because of recent Arab rioting
against Israeli occupation of East
Jerusalem and the adjacent West Bank
territory captured from Jordan in the 1967
war. No major disturbances have been
reported for two weeks, however, and no
incidents disrupted the procession.

Led by brown-robed monks and
prelates in crimson and white, groups of
pilgrims sang hymns and prayed at the 14
 ae

Stations of the Cross before entering the
vast vaults of the Church of the Holy
Sepulcher, on the traditional site ot
Crucifixion,

Yellowish clouds of sand blowing in
from the desert cast a powdery haze over
the walled city of Old Jerusalem. Some ot
the pilgrims held up handkerchiefs to pro-
tect their faces against the sting of the
sand.

The cold, blustery wind heavy with dust
recalled to Christian scholars the climate
of the first Good Friday. They cited the
words of Luke: ‘And there was darkness
over the whole land ... while the sun’s
light faded and the veil of the Temple was
rent in the midst. Then Jesus crying in a
loud voice said, ‘Father, into Thy hands I
commit my spirit.””’

 ",,"ROME (UPI) — Three Arabs shot their way into the
Syrian embassy here with submachine guns today and
seized two hostages to protest Syria's role in the Leban-
ese fighting. They gave up to police after an hour and
freed the hostages unharmed.

One embassy official — a counsellor — was wounded
in the initial attack. Two other embassy employes were
treated for shock.

First reports from the scene indicated the attackers
may have taken as many as five hostages, but embassy
officials later said only two were taken captive.

“Our job is finished. We came to talk to the ambas-
sador but the ambassador was not there,” police quoted
one of the attackers as saying as he gave himself up.

One of the hostages, labor attache Joseph Miro, said
the attackers wanted Syria to end its support of anti-
Palestinian forces in Lebanon.

“They said they wanted us to stop the massacre and to
begin helping the Palestinian-Arab people,” Miro said.

Miro said the second hostage was Ilies Francis, a
Syrian student who was working for the embassy.

“They wanted to make us afraid before making their
demands,” Miro said.

Miro came out of the embassy when the first attacker
gave up to police.

When the second attacker gave up and Francis came
out with him, police mistook him for one of the gunmen
and at first handcuffed the youth instead of the Pales-
tinian.

Police said the attackers told them they were from the
“Black June” group, an apparent reference to the
 beginning of the Syrian offensive against Palestinian
forces in Lebanon.

Syria has backed the rightist Christians in Lebanon,
assisting them in the civil war against leftist Moslems
and Palestinians.

The Syrian role has come under sharp criticism from
Palestinians and Arab leaders who have accused
Damascus of trying to destroy the Palestinian
movement.

into a large and turbulent crowd which refused to disperse.

Violent disorders broke out in various parts of the city, with dem-

grain shop in another,

Eleven were sent to the hospital with bullet wounds suffered when

police fired on a crowd, mostly of students, near Parsurambhau College,
and two were removed to a hospital, Schools and colleges there were
closed. Goondas, the Hindu name for hocdlums, threw bottles through
windows,

The work stoppages in some Bombay mills were in response to
Mohandas K. Gandhi’s “do or die” call for a “complete deadlock” by
strikes and all other non-violent means,
 As the campaign entered its
second day amid shootings, show-

Bands of Hindus stoned some

dozen soldiers to a full platoon.

Moslems Rock Casbah,
Police Fear Outbreak
 ",,"ALGIERS (AP)—A mob of some
5,000 roared through the lower
reaches of the Moslem quarter to-
day shouting nationalist rebel slo-
gans and taunting French soldiers
guarding entrances to the native
city.

Swarms of Moslems’ went
through the twisted streets of the
Casbah shouting ‘‘Abbas to pow-
er’’—rebel Premier Fehrat Abbas
—and ‘‘Moslem Algeria.”

Riot police and soldiers stood
tensely, guns and mortars ready
to fire.

A crowd of Moslems greeted As-
sociated Press staff members,
Andrew Borowiec and David Ma-
son, when the two entered the Cas-
bah. They raised Mason’s arms
over his head and cheered him
when told he was an American
newsman. ;

“This is the insurrection,’’ Mos-
lems shouted. “We are fighting to
the end.”

Other Moslems told Borowiec
ane Mason that soldiers ‘‘killed
‘and wounded many”’ during dis-
iturbances during. the night.
French officials said shots were
fired. but. that there were no

 

 
 deaths.

It was one of the wildest dem-
onstrations ever to rock the Cas-
bah. It centered around the Jew-
ish synagogue which was looted
|Monday. Some Moslems began

stores. The crowds swayed
back and forth in emotional aban-
|don.

At Oran, to the west, all was
reported quiet. A general strike
which paralyzed the city’s econ-
jomy was over. The right-wing
|Front for French Algeria launched
the strike, then rescinded it.

Moslem rioters and the de-
termined resistance of French
settlers have confronted France
with one of the gravest situations
in her attempts to end six years
of the nationalist fight for inde-

e.

No one any longer spoke of
fraternity between Moslem and
Frenchman after five days of
bloody rioting which killed 123
persons and wounded more than
500.
